- to run gstar & g2t with standard physics and geometry settings
  (same as BFC uses) use
     $STAR/kumacs/sim/run_gstar_g2t.kumac

     or 
 
     use BFC -> $STAR/kumacs/chain/call_bfc_gstar_g2t.kumac


- to run gstar & g2t the older way where you can see each
  different physics and geometry setting and how to turn them
  off and on, use

    $STAR/kumacs/sim/run_gstar_g2t_full.kumac


  This uses
    $STAR/kumacs/sim/set_phys_hadronic_off.kumac
                     set_phys_hadronic_on.kumac
                     load_star_geom.kumac

  which one could copy to their area and change if desired.
