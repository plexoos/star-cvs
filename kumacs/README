This document explains the directory structure for kumacs to run
Staf in the new SL98a area.  General instructions for running a kumac
are also given.


The kumacs are in the "new style" ==> 
  have a "chain" kumac which points to individual pam & utility kumacs.

This directory contains kumacs needed to run an analysis chain and
separate "utility" and "pam" kumacs.
In general, if an "analysis chain" kumac is in here, it must point to
the utility and "pam" kumacs it needs (i.e. it should be broken up into
sub-kumacs so it is easier to follow and The subdirectories in this area are:

The main kumac directory is:
  /afs/rhic/star/packages/SL98a/kumacs

 Under this there are the following directories with kumacs

 /util -> utility kumacs
 /pams -> kumac to run a certain pam (this kumac should indicate which
            other pams need to be run in order for it to work)

 /tpc_ss_chain - tpc slow simulator chain (currently here & works!)
 /tpc_laser_chain - tpc laser data analysis chain (working on this)
 /tpc_fs_chain - tpc fast simulator chain (working on this)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, if you want to run a chain you would:

 - copy the chain kumac to your area where you will run staf++
   (e.g. ~tpc_ss_chain/run_tpc_slow_sim_chain_11feb98.kumac)

 - edit it and change parameters at beginning if you need too (# events,
   input data file etc).

 - run staf++
       - load appropriate pams (make tpc in this case)
       - exec run_tpc_slow_sim_chain_11feb98#run
