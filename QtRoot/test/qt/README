The xform program demonstrates rotation/shearing of text and pixmaps.
To build this example do

UNIX:

           cd $ROOTSYS/test/qt
           qmake xform.pro
           make
           root xform.CC
Windows:

           cd %ROOTSYS%/test/qt
           qmake xform.pro
           nmake
           root xform.CC
           
           
Attention. Please, make sure you did get the "test/qt" directory under $ROOTSYS directory. 
---------  The test can not have worked properly if you locate it elsewhere.
