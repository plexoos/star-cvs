                RootShower (Qt-based edition)

This directory contains Qt-based edition of the original RootShower
code written by Bertrand Bellenot (Bertrand.Bellenot@alcan.com) and 
it is available from:

      ftp://root.cern.ch/root/RootShower.tar.gz

The goal of this example is to show how Qt-based ROOT can be used to build 
the complex GUI. 
I tried to preserve the original design and code replacing the ROOT gui classes 
with some from Qt GUI equivalents if possible.

To run this example one needs to install the ROOT Qt-based version  from 
http://root.bnl.gov and invoke the example as follows:

              root RootShower.CC

The source code of the Qt-based version is available from the 
CVS repository (see: http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/QtRoot.html#source )

To retrieve the source code of the example alone do:

 cvs -d :pserver:fine@cvs.bnl.gov:/data01/CVS co root/test/qtRootShower

To re-compile (one is required to install Qt package first) the example from the scratch:

1. Make RootCint dictionary:

   Windows:
      nmake -f Makefile.dict


2. Build the main Makefile with "qmake" utility

      qmake RootShower.pro

3. Compile and build the share (DLL) library:

    [n]make

4. run the example:

    root RootShower.CC

5.  Enjoy.

Attention. Please, make sure you did get the "test/qtRootShower" directory under $ROOTSYS directory. 
---------  The test can not have worked properly if you locate it elsewhere.
