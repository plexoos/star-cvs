This example demonstrates the Qt project file to compile and run qtgsi exampe
as 
  - The Qt-based ROOT shared library build
  - ROOT-base Qt application

The Qt "example1" project contains two sub-projects:

   - dll - to create Qt-based ROOT shared library
   - exe - to create Qt application.
           = It contains the ROOT macro to run "example1"
             as Qt-based application
           = Stand-alone code to run "example1" as 
             ROOT-based  Qt appliciation
           
 Consult ROOT Manual on 
"Qt-based ROOT application" vs "ROOT-based Qt application" definitions

No effort was done to change / debug / alternate the original 
"root/qtgsi/test/example1". It is used "as is" directly.


To  build it from the Qt project file do

   > cd qtRoot/qtExample/qtgsi/example1
   > qmake
   > make

To start the Qt application do:
            
   > cd exe
   > QtGsiTest [-style stylecode] [mode]
   
To start the ROOT application do
   
   > cd exe
   > root Example1.CC
