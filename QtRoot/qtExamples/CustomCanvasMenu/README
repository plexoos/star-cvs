This example is essentially a replica of the "ex1" example with a small addition.
It shows how one can connect TQtCustomizeCanvasMenu event filter to customize 
the ROOT Context Menu.

(Pay your attention to the method "CustomizeIt" in "qtrootexample1.ui.h" file)

To  build and run the application do 

   1. Download and unpack the Qt project directory:
      "http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/downloads/qtRootProject.tar.gz"
      For example use "wget"
      "wget http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/downloads/qtRootProject.tar.gz"
     
   2. "Un-tar" the archive
       tar -xzvf qtRootProject.tar.gz
      
   3. To create the your platform makefile:
   
      "qmake CustomCanvasMenu.pro"
      
   4. To build the application
   
      Unix:
         "make"
      Windows ( no Cygwin!!! ):
         "nmake"    
            
   5. To start the example
      "CustomCanvasMenu [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"
      
     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
     
     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication" 
     for details and other command mode parameters.

To change the design with the Qt designer do

  1. Start Qt "designer" 
     with no parameter 
     
  2. Add the "Custom Qt Widget"
     description to your designer 
     from $ROOTSYS/qt/inc/TQtWidget.cw
     
     Follow the Qt designer menu:
     "Tool" -> "Custom" -> "Edit Custom Widgets" -> "Load Description"
     
  3. Close Qt "Designer"
  4. start designer over with the project file:
  
     "designer CustomCanvasMenu.pro&"


To customzie the ROOT Context menu edit the method "CustomizeIt" from
"qtrootexample1.ui.h" and re-build the project.

The idea of the method belongs Andrea Dotti <andrea.dotti@pi.infn.it> from ATLAS

Note: The steps 1-3 are to be done at once per user account.
      Qt designer will keep the new custom widget definition 
      with Qt designer resource file.
