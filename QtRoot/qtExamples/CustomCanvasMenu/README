This example is essentially a replica of the "ex1" example with a small addition.
It shows how one can connect TQtCustomizeCanvasMenu event filter to customize 
the ROOT Context Menu.

(Pay your attention to the method "CustomizeIt" in "qtrootexample1.ui.h" file)

To  build and run the application do 

   1. To create the your platform makefile:
   
      "qmake CustomCanvasMenu.pro"
      
   2. To build the application
   
      Unix:
         "make"
      Windows ( no Cygwin!!! ):
         "nmake"    
            
   3. To start the example
      "CustomCanvasMenu [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"
      
     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
     

To change the design with the Qt designer do

  1. start designer over with the project file:
  
     "designer CustomCanvasMenu.pro&"


To customzie the ROOT Context menu edit the method "CustomizeIt" from
"qtrootexample1.cxx" and re-build the project.

The idea of the method belongs Andrea Dotti <andrea.dotti@pi.infn.it> from ATLAS
