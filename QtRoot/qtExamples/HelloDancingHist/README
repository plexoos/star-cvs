The Dancing Hist is to demonstrate the painting onto the arbitary 
Qt widget  (QWidget) a few pixmaps generated off-screen with TEmbeddedPad class 
using the simple Qt 2D coordinate transformation (see HelloLife example also).

   1.> qmake
   2.> make

To start the application do:

   3.  "HelloDancingHist  [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"

     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication" 
     for details and other command mode parameters.
