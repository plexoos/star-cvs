This code based on the Qt "life" and ROOT "hsimple.C" examples 
demonstrates using the the Qt "offscreen QPixmap created to back
the ROOT TPad objects: http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/pictures/life.gif 
(see your "$QTDIR/examples/life" and "$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hsimple.C" )

To  build it from the Qt project file do

   1.> qmake
   2.> make

To start the application do:

   3.  "HelloLife   [-scale scale] [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"

     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication" 
     for details and other command mode parameters.

   4. Compare the widget and the png file the example creates with the pattern:
      HelloLife.png
