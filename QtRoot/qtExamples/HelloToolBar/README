This example demonstrates the ROOT-based Qt application with Qt QMainWindow 
and the Qt-based ROOT "Tool Bar".

To  build it from the Qt project file do

   1.> qmake
   2.> make

To start the application do:
            
   3.  "HelloToolBar  [-style=windows | platinum | motif ]"
      
     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication" 
     for details and other command mode parameters.
