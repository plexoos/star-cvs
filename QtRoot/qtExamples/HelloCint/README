This example demonstrates the Qt-based ROOT shared library build

It uses the  Qt project automatically

   1. to create RootCint dictionary,
   2. to compile  the new cusewr class
   3. to create the ROOT shared library.


One can then use the regular ROOT seesion and execute the RootCint.C macro.

To  build it from the Qt project file do

   1.> qmake
   2.> make

To start the application do:
            
   > root.exe HelloCint.C
