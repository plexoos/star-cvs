"HelloFileBrowser" is another small Qt4 application built with Qt4 designer. 
It shows how to use two custom widgets:

   1. "TQtObjectViewFrame" derived from QTreeView widget to represent the TFile structure
       (see: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtreeview.html )
       
   2. "TQtWidget" derived from QWidget to represent the embedded TCanvas

The GUI of the example "promotes" the standard Qt4 widgets to the custom TQtObjectViewFrame and TQtWidget
(see:http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/designer-using-custom-widgets.html#promoting-widgets )

To  build the and run the test application do

   1. "Un-tar" the archive
       tar -xzvf HelloFileBrowser.tar.gz

   2  Invoke:
      qmake
      make

   3. Usage:
      Usage: HelloFileBrowser  [-h | [ -style=[windows | platinum | cgi | kde ]

        The application creates an instance of the widget and populates it with
        the objects read from the ROOT file . It pops up the "Open File Dialog" as
        needed
        (see:http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qfiledialog.html#getOpenFileName )
        
    4. To change the GUI invoke the Qt4 designer:
       
    
    
    One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
    The number of the available different styles is defined by 
    your local Qt installation.

    You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility
