This example demonstrates the Qt-based ROOT application.
It uses the special ROOT class TQtPixmapBox which is subclass of TBox class
The class is a wrapper around of the Qt QPixmap. 
This allows the end-user code to use the Qt facility to generate 
the arbitrary pixmap image (see drawColorWheel function of this example),
then use that pixmap as a regular ROOT object that can be drawn onto 
ROOT TCanvas and interact with the TCanvas interface.

You can build it either 
   1. with the shell script:

      Unix:     HelloPixmap.csh

      Windows:  HelloPimxap.cmd
         
   2. Qt project file:

                HelloPimxap.pro   
      
To  build it with the shell script just invoke

   1. > HelloPixmap.csh  # on Unix
      > HelloPixmap.cmd  # on Windows
      
To  build it from the Qt project file do

   1.> qmake

   2.> make

To start the application do:
            
      "HelloPixmap"
      
     One can define the custom look and feel of the GUI application.
     To do that you should edit the "Gui.Style" parameter from ".rootrc" 
     file included and re-run the example.
 
     Because this is very ROOT application. you have follow ROOT rule rather Qt.
     ( Compare with HelloCanvas/README )
     
     The number of the available different styles is defined by 
     your local Qt installation.
     
     You can check the style available by running "qtconfig" utility

     See: "http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qapplication.html#QApplication" 
     for details and other command mode parameters.
