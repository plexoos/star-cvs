#  Add pyhtia batch job
#
# This script is to submit an example job to execute  NQS queues.
# You can submit it with the command: 
#	qsub -q express star_nqs.batch
# You can modify your copy of this script to suit your needs.
#
# When this script starts executing, assumes as default directory
# the directory from where you submitted it. First compiles any
# fortran files and after that creates the executable at the NQS
# workspace. Several files are linked to the current directory to
# create the default running environment.
# 
# During the execution output files are written at the directory you
# submitted the script. Check if your quota space is enough.
#
#
# NQS embedded directives  follow
#@$-lt 1000      # time limit in seconds
#@$-r  Pythia    # request name
#@$-lf 90mb      # output file size limit
#@$-eo           # merge std error and out
#@$-me           # send mail upon termination
#@$-s /usr/bin/csh # under what shell to execute
#
# Go to the directory from where job was submitted.
#
#printenv
