The "dbServers.xml" file is the means by which the 
DB-API decides which servers to connect on a per-database
basis, when Load Balancer component is disabled or was not 
able to find proper configuration files.

1) About the File

The file contains 1 or more records that are keyed
by:

       <StDbServer> .... information ... </StDbServer>

The information (for MySQL) is:

<name> server name </name>
<host> host name </host>
<port> port number </port>
<socket> unix socket file </socket>
[<databases> datab1, datab2, ... </databases>]

The last field here (databases) is optional. If not 
supplied, this server will be treated as the DEFAULT
server for all databases that are not identified
specifically with a server.

For example, let's say we wish to use the server
on duvall.star.bnl.gov for the Calibrations & Calibrations_tpc
databases but that on db1.star.bnl.gov for all other
database connections. Then the following dbServers.xml file
will do the job,

[sol] ~ > cat dbServers.xml
<StDbServer>
<server> db1 </server>
<host> db1.star.bnl.gov </host>
<port> 3306 </port>
<socket> /tmp/mysql.sock </socket>
</StDbServer>

<StDbServer>
<server> duvall </server>
<host>duvall.star.bnl.gov</host>
<port> 3306 </port>
<socket> /tmp/mysql.sock </socket>
<databases> Calibrations, Calibrations_tpc </databases>
</StDbServer>

[sol] ~ > 


Here, the db1 server does not contain the <databases> key so
it will be treated as the default server. The duvall server
is identified with the databases, Calibrations & Calibrations_tpc.
It will be used for access to these databases.

 
2) About the DB-API access to the file & its behavior

The DB-API will attempt to read 3 dbServer.xml files if
they exist & in the following order

 - $STDB_SERVERS/dbServers.xml
 - $HOME/dbServers.xml
 - $STAR/StDb/servers/dbServers.xml

There are no errors as long as 1 file exists and it contains
either specification to all databases that will be touched during
the process &/or specification to a valid default server.

The following protocols are used:

 - the first default server found is used 
   e.g. if $HOME/dbServers.xml has a default server, we'll ignore
   the one specified in $STAR/StDb/servers/dbServer.xml

 - the first specific server found is also used
   e.g. if $HOME/dbServers.xml contains a specific server of Calibrations,
   that server will be used instead of any similar specification in the
   $STAR/StDb/servers/dbServer.xml
