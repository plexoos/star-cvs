	Compatibility Routines -- C-callable (non-Fortran callable):


	These routines are for compatibility with earlier C-routines which had to
	deal with the Fortran-based aspects of the original msg incarnation.
	These are not Fortran-callable, but nevertheless are "of Fortran" in a sense.
	They should be regarded as destined for the dust bin, and ought not to be
	used in new code.
