TDM is an Analysis Service Package (ASP) for the Standard Analysis
Framework (StAF). An ASP is a package of object interfaces which plug
into the software bus architecture of StAF in a CORBA compliant
interface layer.
.
Each ASP is comprised of an object factory interface (eg. tdmFactory)
and zero or more worker object interfaces.
.
TDM worker objects include:
   tdmDataset - See TDM/DATASET
      - C++ representation of DSL datasets.
   tdmTable - See TDM/TABLE
      - C++ representation of DSL tables.
.
The TDM package is a C++ classs library implementation of the DSL
package for memory-resident datasets and tables.
.
TDM is responsible for memory allocation and management for DSL
datasets and tables, and management of the data dictionary of table
types.
.
tdmDataset objects are container objects which can contain other
tdmDataset objects and/or tdmTable objects. The recursive inclusion of
datasets within datasets forms a hierarchic organization of datasets
which can be thought of as a tree or file-system-like hierarchy.
.
With the ability to link datasets and tables to more than one place,
datasets can form any general directed graph. The TDM interface limits
this more general organization to directed acyclical graphs (ie. When
navigating in only one direction along each node of the graph, each
dataset appears at most once on a navigational path.). This means that
no dataset can contain another dataset which eventually contains the
original dataset (eg. The Unix-like path foo/blah/foo/blah/foo is a
valid path iff each of the foo and blah datasets are distict. foo is
not the same dataset as foo/blah/foo or foo/blah/foo/blah/foo.).
.
Datasets are named, can be contained within other datasets, and can
contain other datasets, and/or tables.
.
DSL tables can be considered arrays of C structs of fixed length
definable in IDL (Interface Definition Language) from the base types:
char, octet, short, unsigned short, long, unsigned long, float, double.
.
Tables are named and typed, can be contained within datasets, and
contain data organized into columns (fields within a C struct) and rows
(elements within the array).
.
Each table column has a name (variable name), a type (a simple or
complex variable type), a rank (the number of dimensions), and a shape
(the sequence of the dimension sizes). Variable types can be scalars,
vectors, multi-dimensional arrays (current limit of 4 indicies),
structs, or any derived type from these complex types.
.
Table types are named (for convenience) and define the columns of a
table in IDL.
.
Some sample IDL table type definitions are:
.
   struct point { float x,y; };
.
   struct point { float x,y,z; };
.
   struct cartesian { float x,y,z; };
.
   struct namedLine {char name[32]; struct point {float x,y,z;}p[2];};
.
Although two of the IDLs above have the same type name, and two have
identical column definitions, these four table types can exist in the
DSL managed data dictionary at the same time and will be treated as
four seperate table types (Obviously, the shortcut of using a type name
instead of the entire type definition will not behave in a
deterministic fashion for the two types named "point".).
.
** ---------------------------------------------------------------------
** TDM/COUNT
>COMMAND COUNT
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
Show the current count of TDM worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
COUNT is a readonly long attribute which reflects the number of TDM
worker objects currently registered with the TDM object factory.
Constructing a new TDM worker object increments COUNT by 1.  
Destroying an existing TDM worker object decrements COUNT by 1.
.
TDM worker objects include:
   tdmDataset - See TDM/DATASET
      - C++ representation of DSL datasets.
   tdmTable - See TDM/TABLE
      - C++ representation of DSL tables.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   None.
.
RETURN:
.
   The current value of COUNT is pushed onto the STAF_RESULT stack
   (see SOC).  A message is also printed to stdout.
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Show the current count of TDM worker objects.
.
   StAF> TDM/COUNT
   TDM:    Object count = 18
.
BUGS: 
   None known.
.
>ACTION KAM_TDM_COUNT
**
** ---------------------------------------------------------------------
** TDM/LIST
>COMMAND LIST
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
List all currently registered TDM worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
Show a tabular one-line description for each TDM worker object currently
registered with the TDM object factory.  Note the DUI/cd, ls and pwd 
commands give a UNIX-like access to the lists of Datasets and Tables. 
.
The one-line description for each object is the result of an invokation
of that object's listing method. The typical content of this listing is:
	0> OID
	   The object's OID attribute (see SOC) presented as "%5d".
	1> Lock State
           The object's LOCK attribute (see SOC) presented as the
	   divider character between the OID column and the NAME:OBJECT
	   column. An object whose LOCK attribute is TRUE (cannot be
	   deleted) uses the "-" character, whereas an object whose
	   LOCK attribute is FALSE (can be deleted) uses "|" character.
	2> NAME:OBJECT
	   The object's NAME attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object names longer than 15 characters are abreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint.
	   An object name is synonymous with an object instance.
	3> TYPE:CLASS
	   The object's TYPE attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object types longer than 15 characters are abreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint. 
	   An object type is synonymous with an object class.
	4> DESCRIPTION
	   A class-specific description of the object.  For Datasets the
           number of entries are shown and for tables the number of used
           and allocated rows and the number of bytes of each row.
.
TDM worker objects include:
   tdmDataset - See TDM/DATASET
      - C++ representation of DSL datasets.
   tdmTable - See TDM/TABLE
      - C++ representation of DSL tables.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
   None.
.
RETURN: 
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   tdmFactory::list()
   method is pushed onto the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. List all currently registered TDM worker objects.

return the value contained in a single cell of a table.

.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
GETVALUE is a member function of CELL components of objects which
implement the tdmTable interface whcih returns the contents of the CELL.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting a CELL component of an object implementing the 
     tdmTable interface.  Must be enclosed in single quotes with the
     row number in square brackets and the column name preceded by a 
     period.  If the row number is the content of a KUIP variable
     (a common usage) the need to include the variable in square brackets
     requires the ugly format 'table_name['//[row_variable]//'].col_name
.
RETURN:
.
   The contents of the cell are returned in staf_result(1)
   A message with the contents is also printed to stdout.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   method is pushed onto the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
 EG1. STAF> tdm/table/cell/getvalue 'tpt_spars[0].last_row'
 TDMTABLE:       Cell data =     45
.
EXCEPTIONS: 
.
   OBJECT_NOT_FOUND - No CELL component specified by SOREF can be
      found for an object which implements the tdmTable interface.
      (See SOC/BIND to dynamically bind the proper resources, or
      rebuild executable with the proper resources statically linked.)
   INVALID_TABLE_COLUMN - Found the table but not the cell.
.
BUGS: 
.
   It is inconvenient that the contents of the cell are printed (good
   for interactive use but for production there is no way to suppress this?) 
   and to get the value for use in a kumac it is necessary to fetch it from
   staf_result(1).
   An ill-formed cell reference causes a segmentation fault.

Insert data into a cell of a table.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
PUTVALUE can be used to change the contents of one cell of a table.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting a CELL component of a Table.  Note the table row is
   enclosed in square brackets and the column name should follow
   a period.  The whole SOREF is enclosed in single quotes.  If the
   row number is the content of a KUIP variable (a common usage) the
   need to include the variable in square brackets requires the ugly
   format 
           'table_name['//[row_variable]//'].col_name
.
.
   VALUES - List of new cell values.  Unless the cell is defined as an
   array, this will be a single VALUE.  For an array cell, all members
   must be listed, separated by blanks.
.
RETURN:
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   method is pushed onto the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).

.
EG2.
 tdm/table/cell/putvalue 'tpt_spars[0].skip' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
.
EXCEPTIONS: 
.
   OBJECT_NOT_FOUND -  Table name is wrong or SOREF not in single quotes.
   INVALID_TABLE_COLUMN -  CELL specified by SOREF not found.
. 
BUGS: 
.
   Ill-formed SOREF's produce Segmentation violation errors.
   If the variable is an array, unspecified members are often filled with
   arbitrary junk.  Makes it impractical to use interactively on large 
   arrays.   It would be nice to have a more flexible input
   structure like 1 2 3 5*0 11*1 9 8 2 - or something like that.
