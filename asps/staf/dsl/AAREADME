An important message concerning the dsl package
-----------------------------------------------

The dsl package must use its own Makefiles, and not the standard 
slm Makefiles.  This is because dsl needs to work under VxWorks 
as well as under Unix.

To build the library, use the command "make", not "make lib".

The top Makefile now uses STAR_SYS_LEVEL for "make install".
