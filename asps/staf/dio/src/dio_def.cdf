.
DIO is an Analysis Service Package (ASP) for the Standard Analysis
Framework (StAF). An ASP is a package of object interfaces which plug
into the software bus archictecture of StAF in a CORBA compliant
interface layer.
.
Each ASP is comprised of an object factory interface (eg. dioFactory)
and zero or more worker object interfaces.
.
DIO worker objects include:
   dioStream - See DIO/STREAM
      - A generic data stream object. Abstract base class for all dio
        stream objects.
   dioFileStream - See DIO/FILESTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a disk file.
   dioSockStream - See DIO/SOCKSTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a TCP/IP socket.
   dioTapeStream - See DIO/TAPESTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a magnetic tape device.
      - NOTICE -- dioTapeStream is not yet implemented.
.
The DIO worker objects handle input to and output from stream-like
sources of data containing XDF (XDR-based Dataset Format) data.
.
Each XDF data stream contains a sequence of unencapsulated DSL datasets
containing zero or more tables and/or other datasets. For historical
reasons, an unencapsulated dataset is refered to as an "event".
However, this is not an accurate term.
.
In this ASP, the term event simply refers to a dataset in an XDF stream
which is not contained within another dataset (ie. is unencapsulated by
another dataset).
.
These "events" can actually refer to real physics events, calibration
sets, header datasets, etc. The important distinction to be made is
that each READ or WRITE operation operates on a single dataset and its
sub-hierarchy (ie. all datasets and tables below the single dataset
within the overall hierarchy).
.
As an example: Consider the following hypothetical hierarchy of
datasets (lowercase names) and tables (UPPERCASE NAME).
.
	      .--EMC_GAIN
	      |--STAR_BFIELD
       .--calib/

		   `----TPC_MAP
.
If the "event/" dataset is written to or read from an XDF stream, a
total of 12 datasets and 21 tables will be output or input. If,
however, the "event/data/raw/" dataset is written to or read from an
XDF stream, only 1 dataset and 5 tables will be output or input.
.
For details of the XDF data format, please see Web pages for the DSL
package.

** DIO/COUNT
>COMMAND COUNT
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
Show the current count of DIO worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
COUNT is a readonly long attribute which reflects the number of DIO
worker objects currently registered with the DIO object factory.
Constructing a new DIO worker object increments COUNT by 1,
destroying an existing DIO worker object decrements COUNT by 1.
.
DIO worker objects include:
   dioStream - See DIO/STREAM
      - A generic data stream object. Abstract base class for all dio
        stream objects.
   dioFileStream - See DIO/FILESTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a disk file.
   dioSockStream - See DIO/SOCKSTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a TCP/IP socket.
   dioTapeStream - See DIO/TAPESTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a magnetic tape device.
      - NOTICE -- dioTapeStream is not yet implemented.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   None.
.
RETURN:
.
   The current value of COUNT is pushed onto the STAF_RESULT stack
   (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Show the current count of DIO worker objects.
.

>ACTION KAM_DIO_COUNT

** ---------------------------------------------------------------------
** DIO/LIST
>COMMAND LIST
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
List all currently registered DIO worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
Show a one-line description for each DIO worker object currently
registered with the DIO object factory in a table for quick,
simple perusal.
.
The one-line description for each object is the result of an invokation
of that object's listing method. The typical content of this listing is:
	0> OID
	   The object's OID attribute (see SOC) presented as "%5d".
	1> Lock State
           The object's LOCK attribute (see SOC) presented as the
	   divider character between the OID column and the NAME:OBJECT
	   column. An object whose LOCK attribute is TRUE (cannot be
	   deleted) uses the "-" character, whereas an object whose
	   LOCK attribute is FALSE (can be deleted) uses "|" character.
	2> NAME:OBJECT
	   The object's NAME attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object names longer than 15 characters are abreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint.
	   An object name is synonymous with an object instance.
	3> TYPE:CLASS
	   The object's TYPE attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object types longer than 15 characters are abreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint. 
	   An object type is synonymous with an object class.
	4> DESCRIPTION
	   A class-specific description of the object.
	   For Filestreams this is the name of the file with indicators 
           whether it is read/write and whether it is open/closed.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   None.
.
RETURN: 
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   dioFactory::list()
   method is pushed onto the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).

ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting an object implementing the dioStream interface.
.
   MODE - Read/write mode
   - Options are READING and WRITING

RETURN:

the mode to Write-only.

>GUIDANCE
Write a dataset from memory to an XDF data stream.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
PUTEVENT is a member function of objects which implement the dioStream
interface, including:
.
   dioFileStream - See DIO/FILESTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a disk file.
   dioSockStream - See DIO/SOCKSTREAM
      - A data stream object associated with a TCP/IP socket. 
      The stream must be open and in WRITE mode.
   Dataset contents ( typically tables and other datasets ) are written
 from memory to an output stream.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting an object implementing the dioStream interface.
.
   DATASET - Path to an in-memory dataset name.
.
RETURN:
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   dioStream::PUTEVENT
   method is pushed on the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Write the dataset Tracks contained in the dataset ProducedData
to the filestream DST.
.
 staf++ > dio/stream/putevent DST ProducedData/Tracks
.
EG2. Write the entire ProducedData dataset to the filestream DST.
.
 staf++ > dio/stream/putevent DST ProducedData
.
EXCEPTIONS: 
.
   OBJECT_NOT_FOUND - No object specified by SOREF can be found which
      implements the dioStream interface.
      (See SOC/BIND to dynamically bind the proper resources, or
      rebuild executable with the proper resources statically linked.)
   BAD_MODE_OR_STATE - Attempt to write to a readonly stream or a closed
      stream.
.
BUGS: 
.
   None known.
