TOP is an Analysis Service Package (ASP) for the Standard Analysis
Framework (StAF). An ASP is a package of object interfaces which plug
into the software bus archictecture of StAF in a CORBA compliant
interface layer.
.
Each ASP is comprised of an object factory interface (eg. topFactory)
and zero or more worker object interfaces.
.
TOP worker objects include:
   topCut - See TOP/CUT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting rows from a table.
   topJoin - See TOP/JOIN_AGENT
      - An operator object for joining row-by-row data from two tables.
   topProject - See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting columns from a table.
   topSort - See TOP/SORT_AGENT
      - An operator object for reordering rows in a table.
.
** ---------------------------------------------------------------------
** TOP/COUNT
>COMMAND COUNT
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
Show the current count of TOP worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
COUNT is a readonly long attribute which reflects the number of TOP
worker objects currently registered with the TOP object factory.
Constructing a new TOP worker object increments COUNT by 1,
destroying an existing TOP worker object decrements COUNT by 1.
.
TOP worker objects include:
   topCut - See TOP/CUT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting rows from a table.
   topJoin - See TOP/JOIN_AGENT
      - An operator object for joining row-by-row data from two tables.
   topProject - See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting columns from a table.
   topSort - See TOP/SORT_AGENT
      - An operator object for reordering rows in a table.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   None.
.
RETURN:
.
   The current value of COUNT is pushed onto the STAF_RESULT stack
   (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Show the current count of TOP worker objects.
.
   StAF> TOP/COUNT

** TOP/LIST
>COMMAND LIST
>PARAMETERS
>GUIDANCE
List all currently registered TOP worker objects.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
Show a one-line description for each TOP worker object currently
registered with the TOP object factory in a table for quick,
simple perusal.
.
The one-line description for each object is the result of an invokation
of that object's listing method. The typical content of this listing is:
	0> OID
	   The object's OID attribute (see SOC) presented as "%5d".
	1> Lock State
           The object's LOCK attribute (see SOC) presented as the
	   divider character between the OID column and the NAME:OBJECT
	   column. An object whose LOCK attribute is TRUE (cannot be
	   deleted) uses the "-" character, whereas an object whose
	   LOCK attribute is FALSE (can be deleted) uses "|" character.
	2> NAME:OBJECT
	   The object's NAME attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object names longer than 15 characters are abbreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint.
	   An object name is synonymous with an object instance.
	3> TYPE:CLASS
	   The object's TYPE attribute (see SOC) presented as "%-15s".
	   Object types longer than 15 characters are abbreviated with a
	   "~" character at midpoint. 
	   An object type is synonymous with an object class.
	4> DESCRIPTION
	   A class-specific description of the object.
	   Sorts list nothing.  Joins lists too much to fit the field.
.
TOP worker objects include:
   topCut - See TOP/CUT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting rows from a table.
   topJoin - See TOP/JOIN_AGENT
      - An operator object for joining row-by-row data from two tables.
   topProject - See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT
      - An operator object for selecting columns from a table.

topCut object commands.
.
Commands found under the TOP/CUT_AGENT menu can be applied to objects
which implement the topCut interface.
.
The CUT (or FILTER) operation in TOP is analogous to the cut operation
on NTuples in PAW. It eliminates rows from a table which do not satisfy
some criterion expressed as a function of the column variables of that
table.
.
The distinction between CUT and FILTER is whether a new table is
created (FILTER) with rows that pass the cut criterion or rows within
the input table which do not pass the cut criterion are removed (CUT).

** TOP/JOIN_AGENT
>MENU \JOIN_AGENT
>GUIDANCE
topJoin object commands.
.
Commands found under the TOP/JOIN_AGENT menu can be applied to objects
which implement the topJoin interface.
.
A JOIN (or FASTJOIN) operation in TOP is analogous to a join operation
in any Relational DataBase system. A topJoin object combines data
from two tables into a third table on a row-by-row basis subject to a 
condition on one or more column variables as defined by a where clause
specification string.
.
In TOP, the join method function of a topJoin object actually performs
a join and a project. Hence, the JOIN (or FASTJOIN) command takes both
a Where Clause *and* a Selection Specification (see TOP/PROJECT).
.
    +--------------------------------------+
    | Where Clause                         |
    +--------------------------------------+
    A where clause is used to define the condition for joining
    rows of two tables in a join (and project).
.
    The syntax of a where clause has the format:
        '{' join_pair_specifier ',' ... '}'
    where a join_pair_specifier is of the form:
        column_specifier
    or:
        column_specifier <WHITE_SPACE> column_specifier
    where the two column_specifier's MUST come from different tables
    and where a column_specifier is of the form:
        column_name
    or:
        table_name '.' column_name
.
    If a where clause is applied for a join (and project), the
    output table will contain rows composed of data from both 
    tables where both tables have equal (INTEGER) values in the
    specified columns (eg. equal primary-key/foreign-key pairs).
.
    If no where clause is applied for a join (and project) the join
    will occur on all (INTEGER) columns with the same name in both
    tables.
.
    Examples:
        '{id}'
        '{pkey fkey}'
        '{tab1.pkey tab2.fkey}'
        '{g2t_vertex.id g2t_track.start_vertex_p}'

** TOP/JOIN_AGENT/SELECTSPEC SOREF
>COMMAND SELECTSPEC

DESCRIPTION: 
.
SELECTSPEC is a readonly attribute which defines the mapping of input
table columns to output table columns for JOIN (or FASTJOIN) operations
performed by the topJoin SOREF. Readonly attributes cannot be changed
from the user interface.
.
SELECTSPEC is the SQL-like Selection Specification string for a topJoin
object.  See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT for syntax of Selection Specification strings.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.

>GUIDANCE
Join two sorted tables to fill a third.
.
DESCRIPTION: 
.
FASTJOIN is a member function of objects which implement the topJoin
interface.
.
You can read about joining in a book on relational databases
(eg, an SQL reference book).
You can use the same JOIN agent with either JOIN or FASTJOIN.
FASTJOIN works the same as JOIN, except as noted below.
.
It runs very fast (proportional to n instead of n squared).
Eg, two 10,000 row tables that previously took 20 minutes will
run in 0.12 seconds.
.
You must first sort each table on its corresponding
column in the WHERE clause of FASTJOIN.
You can sort the tables easily with TOP/SORT_AGENT/SORT.
This sort is based on a fancy sorting algorithm (quicksort),
and runs very fast.
.
The WHERE parameter must be simple, ie,
'{' column_name <WHITE_SPACE> column_name '}'.
No commas, no periods.
The first  column_name is for the first  table.
The second column_name is for the second table.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting an object implementing the topJoin interface.
.
   TABLE1 - tdmTable name of 1st input table.
.
   TABLE2 - tdmTable name of 2nd input table.
.
   TABLE3 - tdmTable name of output table.
	  - Result of JOIN operation.
          - If TABLE3 does not exist, it will be created with the
	    proper columns as defined by topJoin object SOREF.
.
   SELECT - Selection specification.
	  - See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT for syntax of SELECT.
          - If topJoin object SOREF does not exist, create it with
	    selection specification string SELECT.
.
   WHERE - Where clause specification.
	 - See TOP/JOIN_AGENT for syntax of WHERE.
         - If topJoin object SOREF does not exist, create it with
	   where clause string WHERE.
.
RETURN:
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   topJoin::FASTJOIN
   method is pushed on the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Use an existing join object, j050 (defined by top/newjoin)
     to join selected rows of the presorted ntphit and strack tables
     into table newhit.

DESCRIPTION: 
.
JOIN is a member function of objects which implement the topJoin
interface.
.
ARGUMENTS: 
.
   SOREF - Stringified Object REFerence (see SOC).
   - denoting an object implementing the topJoin interface.
.
   TABLE1 - tdmTable name of 1st input table.
.
   TABLE2 - tdmTable name of 2nd input table.
.
   TABLE3 - tdmTable name of output table.
          - Result of JOIN operation.
          - If TABLE3 does not exist, it will be created with the
	    proper columns as defined by topJoin object SOREF.
.
   SELECT - Selection specification.
          - See TOP/PROJECT_AGENT for syntax of SELECT.
          - If topJoin object SOREF does not exist, create it with
	    selection specification string SELECT.
.
   WHERE - Where clause specification.
         - See TOP/JOIN_AGENT for syntax of WHERE.
         - If topJoin object SOREF does not exist, create it with
	   where clause specification string WHERE.
.
RETURN:
.
   Success (STAFCV_OK) or failure (STAFCV_BAD) of the 
   topJoin::JOIN
   method is pushed on the STAF_STATUS stack (see SOC).
.
EXAMPLES: 
.
EG1. Use an existing join object, j050 (defined by top/newjoin)
     to join selected rows of the unsorted ntphit and strack tables
     into table newhit.

topProject object commands.
.
Commands found under the TOP/PROJECT_AGENT menu can be applied to
objects which implement the topProject interface.
.
A PROJECT operation in TOP is analogous to a project operation in any
Relational DataBase system. A topProject object takes as input a table
with columns a,b,c,e,f and projects it onto a table (new or extant)
with columns a,e,c (as an example). The definition of the projection is
contained in a selection specification string.
.
    +--------------------------------------+
    | Selection Specification              |
    +--------------------------------------+
    A selection specification is used to select columns for a
    table output from a project (or join and project).
.
    The syntax of a selection specification has the format:
        '{' select_column_specifier ',' .... '}'
    where a select_column_specifier is of the form:
        column_specifier
    or:
        column_specifier <WHITE_SPACE> new_column_name
    where a column_specifier is of the form:
        column_name
    or:
        table_name '.' column_name
.
    If a selection specification is applied for a project (or a
    join and project), the output table will contain only those
    columns specified by the selection specification.
.
    If no selection specification is applied for a project (or a 
    join and project), the output table will contain all columns
    from the input table(s).
.
    Examples:
        '{x, y, z}'
        '{x q1, y q2, z q3}'
        '{intab.x outab.q1, intab.y outab.q2, intab.z outab.q3}'
        '{g2t_vertex.id vid, g2t_track.ge_pid, g2t_track.n_tpc_hit}'

SELECTSPEC is a readonly attribute which defines the mapping of input
table columns to output table columns for PROJECT operations performed
by the topProject SOREF. Readonly attributes cannot be changed from the
user interface.
