>Command DETP
>Parameters
Detector 'detector subsystem name' C
+
NAME  'name of the selected bank or of a variable in the bank' C
Value 'value of the selector or new value of the variable    ' R
>Guidance
 
 DETP command provides a way to modify the content of parameter banks.
 
When a USE operator is called for a bank for the first time,
it checks wether the bank name and the value of its selector
coincides with the one mentioned in the DETP command for the same detector.
If this is the case, corresponding variables in the bank are replaced
by the new value. Selector name and value is provided in brackets
after the bank name. If no name (only a value) is provided,
this refers to the selector in the USE operator itself.
 
 Only one DETP command per detector is kept in the program.
The next command with the same detector name overwrites the previous one.
On the other hand, any number of banks and their variable
can be changed by a single command (which can be extended
over several lines following KUIP rules).
When data are read from P stream, they are stripped out of
old DETP commands.
 
 Typing rules for  DETP parameters are the following:
 - the bank selector value may be given in () or with a = sign.
 - variable to change should have a trailing = sign.
 - command is not case sensitive.
 
 Example.
 DETP CALO cgeo=1  rmin=200  rmax=300
 DETP CALO cgeo(1).rmin=200  rmax=300
 DETP CALO cgeo(version=1).rmin=200  rmax=300
 
DETP command may be generated also from the code using two
subroutines:  AgDETPnew (Detector) and AgDETPadd (Name,Values,Nval).
 
 Example. The previous command may be generated by:
 Call AgDETP new ('CALO')
 Call AgDETP add ('cgeo(version=1).rmin=',200,1)
 Call AgDETP add ('rmax=',300,1)

  B      - background events to pile up on top of physics events,
  I      - general input data (no geometry record in the beginning),
  O      - output data.
 
 Data types may be:
 ' ' - Standard GENZ Zebra format with Lrec=8100 (default),

  L  - Records include Length (Fortran-type OPEN used),
  F  - Fatmen catalog used to access Zebra tapes,
  N  - special Colomn Wise Ntuple with GENZ-type events for input,
  U  - user defined data type. In this case user has to supply his own
       routines AGUSREAD(ier) and to link it dinamically using gexec.
       The input file is opened by default on unit 20 as FORMATTED.
       For a user-specific file openning user has to provide his own
       routine AGUSOPEN(file) and to link it dinamically using gexec.
  1  - read only till the first ZEBRA End_of_file
       (default is a multy-file input stream),
  C  - do not merge splitted or piled-up subevents, keep them in a chain
       (by default they are automatically merged in a single event).
 
File: is the name of the data file.
It may include directory path and wildcard characters.
Default extensions for the default file name are P, B and O.
 
Sets: list of data sets to be read or written:	
 G - GEANT detector geometry plus DETM bank
     (unless they are already loaded or created)
 E - GENZ RUNT/EVNT banks with parton level information,
 K - Geant KINE/VERT/HEAD information,
 H - HIT banks,
 D - DIGI banks,
 R - reconstruction banks,
 S - data structure description (both include files and rz-database) is
     updated automatically as it is done with the default STRUCTURES commands,
 * - all above (default).
 
Note that GEANT simulations are allowed ONLY if the input does not contain
hits or digits (i.e. disallowed by default list!).
 
Modif (to be implemented on request):
  The way how the * wildcard character is replaced using the

>Command REBANK
>Guidance
 
Bank access mechanism is implemeted as it is described in the
Atlas note SOFT-NO-002. The only correction to the note is the call
to the REBANK itself, which now has an additional parameter Ia:
 
          call REBANK (Path,IDN,Npar,Link*,Ia*)
 
The returned value of Ia contains the displacement in the bank,
for a single raw request. Remember that this routine is not intended
for general usage and should be avoided - use FILL/USE operators or
RBSTORE/RBCOPY, RBGET/RBPUT routines instead.
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Command FILL
>Guidance
 
FILL operatore is fully described in the AGI manual (Atlas note SOFT-NO-14).
Here we provide some additional details and helpful hints.
 
 Although names of the variables in AGI structures are limited to 12
characters, DZDOC suports only 8 characters in the documentation.
That means that in the structure defintion, produced by AGI (see also
STRUCTURES and TABLES commands), all names will be TRUNCATED to 8 symbols.
To avoid this complification, user is advised to use in structures
variable names not longer than 8 charactes.
 
>Action AGXUSER
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Command USE
>Guidance
 
Here we provide some general guidance in addition to the Atlas note
SOFT-NO-014, for using USE operator in the reconstruction code.
 
 the complete format of the USE operator is
 
 USE Path [ variable=value ] [ OPER={DELETE/UNIQUE/NEXT/ZERO} ] [ STAT=istat ]
 
All fields apart from Path are optional.
 
  Path : is the Unix-like path to the selected bank or a chain of banks
         It may include after bank names integer indeces
         If omitted, default value for index is supposed to be 1.
 
         The Path may be absolute, i.e. starting from /DETM or /RECB, in
         which case the selected bank becomes the Current Working Directory
         or relative, i.e. starting from the current working directory,
         selected by the previous USE operator.
         Module names in the begining of the path are recognized as
         the absolute path in DETM tree.
 
  OPER:  Different operations are :
   DELETE - deletes the selected bank from the tree AFTER copying its
            content in the corresponding structure
   ZERO   - reset the bank content to ZERO (agaim AFTER coping)
   UNIQUE - moves the selected bank to the first position in the chain
            and drops all other banks in this chain making a unique
            version available for the further analysis.
   NEXT   - select the next bank in the chain without searching the
            path again. If STAT option is used, this is done only
            if the status control variable is OK [0], otherwise
            a normal search in the path is done, thus allowing
            to select a starting bank and its descendent in the
            same USE
 
  STAT=ISTAT returns in ISTAT the bank access status (0 if OK).
             Initial value of ISTAT should be defined with a DATA statement.
 
If structure description in the program is different from the one in ZEBRA
memory, local copy is filled correctly using documentation. New variables,
not present in the bank, are left intact.
 
 Example: suppose a bank has been created by the following module:
 --------
      module    somegeo is a system
      author    me
      created   today
      integer   iprin
      structure MFLG { version, int Bfield(2,3), RmaxInn, ZmaxInn ,char title}
      fill MFLG(1)                  !  system data
          version =1                   !  bank version
          Bfield  = {1,2; 4,5; 11,12}  !  some field value
          RmaxInn = 100                !  max rad
          ZmaxInn = 200                !  max len
          title   = 'abcdef'           !  some 4-letter text
      end
 
 Then you try to read it with the following subroutine:
 -----
      subroutine sometest
      integer   iprin,istat/0/,i
      structure MFLG { int version, char title, int aaa,
                       Bfield(3,2), RmaxInn, ZmaxInn }
      begin
      mflg_aaa  = 999
      use  SOMEGEO/MFLG
      print *, ' version, aaa, ZmaxInn, title, Bfield: '
      print *,mflg_version,mflg_aaa,mflg_ZmaxInn,' ',mflg_title,mflg_Bfield
      end
 
 Result will be the following:
 ------
 Schema evolution for Bpath=/DETM/SOME/MFLG* bank=MFLG:
  version, aaa, ZmaxInn, title, Bfield:
   2  999    200.000 abcd    1.00000    2.00000  0.    4.00000    5.00000  0.

type    'type of the output'                                   C  D='def'
 
>Guidance
 
Produce a definition file with data structure description and
update the documentation database (detm.rz) in accordance with the
structures currenly loaded in the program.
 
System name argument is interpreted in the same way as the argument in
the UNIX 'ls' command, for example:
 - no name at all produces a single output file (detmsys) with all structure descriptions in it;
 - '*' produces a set of system-based output files (*sys) with its related structure description;
 - sys/name produces a single structure definition.
 
Type of the output may be
 
  def   - AGI preprocessor input file (default),
  idl   - CORBA interface definitions language,
  other - internal table format
 
The detmsys.def output may be automatically read by the AGI parser so that user
can get access to structure description with +cde or +include statements.
CORBA idl file should be processed by STIC compiler to produce .inc and .h
files. Internal definition file is directly fed to table access module.

>Guidance
Makes AGI structures, which belong to a particular AGI system, visible as
StaF tables in the requested dataset. Apropriate STAF table descriptions
is derived from AGI description and actual table adresses are mapped to AGI
structures. Default value means "all system".
A subset of structures can also be convertes into tables
by defining the path to them.
 
By default, all tables are created in /dui/Run, but
destination can be redirectded to another dataset.
If the dataset does not exist yet, it will be created
(but not the whole path!)

>Command ONFAULT

fault   'name of the arithmetic fault signal flag'         C D='IDO'
counter 'number of faults to catch '                       I D=1
handler 'name of an optional user error handler routine'   C D=' '
 
>Guidance.
 
Catch certain number of arithmetic faults of selected type and print
tracing diagnostic. To provide a meaningful diagnostic, user code should
be compiled with '-g' option (unfortunatly, not all of the cernlib
routines are compiled with it!).
 
 - fault parameter:
 
List of possible fault types is computer dependant.
Here we describe the HPUX version only, which can detect:
(I) - illegal instruction, (D) - division by 0,
(O) - floating overflow, (U) - floating underflow,  and (X) - inexact numbers.
Last two happens very often and should not be normally considered as errors.
In addition (*) subsitutes all five flags, (+) means do not alter flags other
then mentioned in the command, which otherwise are reset to IGNORE.
If a fault type was never mentioned in any ONFAULT commands and they all
had +'s, corresponding error handler is still activated with the default
behaviour defined in libm.a.
 
 - counter meaning:
 
A positive counter sets the number of extended error messages to be printed,
the rest is counted in the common block /agerrorcount/ nnum(5),mmax(5),
but not reported. Error handler is permanently activated.
 
A zero counter forces the program to simulate a kuip break after the error
message is printed. If this happens in a macro, executed on a kuip prompt,
the kuip will issue the prompt again. If this happens in macro started in
a command line, program will stop.
 
If the counter is negative, corresponding faults are completely ignored
(not even counted).
 
 - handler:
 
If defined, a user handler routine is called instead of the
standard CERNLIB tracing routine.

INFILE1 'First input file name' C D=' '
+
INFILE2 'Second input file name (must be TX)' C D=' '
>Guidance
Opens one or two files of events as input to Geant. If read types FZ
(Zebra) or TX (Star new text format) are given, only one file of the given
type is opened using the first input filename. If read type FZTX or
TXOTX is given, two files are opened and merged within Geant. For
the FZTX option, the first filename must be an FZ file and the second
filename a TX file (new text format). For the TXOTX, the first file
must be an old format text file, and the second a TX file.
In the FZTX and TXOTX options, if the tracks and vertices of the two files
are to be disentangled again downstream of Geant, it is the user's
responsibility to ensure that they are labelled in a unique way. One
simple way to do this is to make all vertex processes in the TX file
negative.
 
If a file of the given type is open at the time of this call, it will be
closed before further action is taken.

PID3 'Geant PID of third decay daughter, if present' I D=0
>Guidance
Initializes parameters for the decay of a particle with uniform
probability along its trajectory between the cylindrical surfaces
R=RIN and R=ROUT. This can be used to enhance statistics for the
efficiency studies of the reconstruction of decays. A new particle is
defined, having PIDNEW=PIDPARENT+200, and which does not have any
decay modes defined in Geant. When particle PIDPARENT appears in the
input list of kinematics, its pid is replaced by PIDNEW. It is
propogated from its origin through the surface R=ROUT, and then a decay
point is chosen uniformly along its trajectory between RIN and
ROUT. GSTAR explicitly creates a new vertex at this decay point, with
100% branching ratio for decay into the two or three daughters
defined, with kinematics defined appropriately (three-body decay
assumes scalar particles). Since the path length to the generated
vertex and the parent 4-momentum are known, the appropriate weighting
factor for the vertex due to the lifetime of the parent can be
calculated.

 2 - some secondaries are saved in KINE bank.
     This concerns decay products of particles, already existing in KINE.
     Other products (than decay) of these particles are saved in KINE
     only if they are produced in specially named media, which should
     be different from the medium, where the parent was born.
