Option 'program actions allowed'   C    D='*'
>Guidance
This command can be used to overwrite the default program actions,
derived from the nature of input data.

List of program actions, allowed in the run, is :
 K - convertion GENZ banks to KINE
 S - Geant simulations
 D - Hit digitization
 R - reconstruction
 T - test beam data analysis.
 O - automatic output at the end of TRIG command

This command can be used to steer version dependance,
which cannot be derived from the nature of input data.

List of available program version :

 ATLAS,STAF,DENS - Different packing versions for REBANK, affects
                   the number of user banks per single ZEBRA bank
 BATCH           - no errors are tolarated in I/O commands (gexec,gfile)
 INTER           - return to normal (interactive) error handling
 FZLEN           - max length of output FZ file in Mwords (512 is 2GB)
 GTRACK          - generic keys to control tracking modes.
 RZ95, RZ96      - Different key formats in RZ files (affects RZ/FILE)
                   (now recognised automatically

For the moment the first key switches  GUSCNTR in GTRACK,
the second one switches additional call to GTMEDI in case of MANY;
The third one (3 digits) modifies logic of GTXXXX routines.
Default setting (all 0s) corresponds to what is believed
today (05.10.00) to be the best choice - purely 99 cernlib
tracking apart from diff=(Vout-Vnext) which is taken as abs(diff).

>guidance
Dumps the content of a selected sub-branch of ZEBRA banks,
addressed by the PATH.

Possible options are:
 F - dump in a file instead of the terminal. The bank name is used as
     the file name with .sgml extension
 H - convert the dump file in HTML formated set of files with
     apropriate hyperlinks beween them.
     Each bank in the structure is described in a separate file
     with the name of the bank and its top level bank as the filename
     and with .html extension.
 C - dump only numbers without variable names and comments. This may
     be usefull for an output intended to be read by another program.
 U - dump also banks which have no documenation (normally they are skipped),
 1 - dump also long banks (more than 1000 word - normally they are skipped).

>Command DETP
>Parameters
Detector 'detector subsystem name' C
+
NAME  'name of the selected bank or of a variable in the bank' C
Value 'value of the selector or new value of the variable    ' R
>Guidance

 DETP command provides a way to modify the content of parameter banks.

When a USE operator is called for a bank for the first time,
it checks wether the bank name and the value of its selector
coincides with the one mentioned in the DETP command for the same detector.
If this is the case, corresponding variables in the bank are replaced
by the new value. Selector name and value is provided in brackets
after the bank name. If no name (only a value) is provided,
this refers to the selector in the USE operator itself.

 Only one DETP command per detector is kept in the program.
The next command with the same detector name overwrites the previous one.
On the other hand, any number of banks and their variable
can be changed by a single command (which can be extended
over several lines following KUIP rules).
When data are read from P stream, they are stripped out of
old DETP commands.

 Typing rules for  DETP parameters are the following:
 - the bank selector value may be given in () or with a = sign.
 - variable to change should have a trailing = sign.
 - command is not case sensitive.

 Example.
 DETP CALO cgeo=1  rmin=200  rmax=300
 DETP CALO cgeo(1).rmin=200  rmax=300
 DETP CALO cgeo(version=1).rmin=200  rmax=300

DETP command may be generated also from the code using two
subroutines:  AgDETPnew (Detector) and AgDETPadd (Name,Values,Nval).

 Example. The previous command may be generated by:
 Call AgDETP new ('CALO')
 Call AgDETP add ('cgeo(version=1).rmin=',200,1)
 Call AgDETP add ('rmax=',300,1)

>Guidance
Generates particles with flat phase space distribution
(instead of input events from a file) or to provide a particle filter
parameters for external generator input.
.
Mandatory parameters are number of tracks per event and Geant particle ID for
particle in-line generation. Following optional parameters are
lower and upper bounds of pT, pseudorapidity and azimouth anlge intervals.
If no parameters are given, a single muon will be generated per event,
distributed uniformly in the interval 0<pT<10 GeV, -10<y<10, 0<phi<2pi.
.
To switch to PDG particle ID instead of the GEANT one, the options P or
E can be used (PDG particle ID may also be negative).
In this case user can switch from the transverse momentum range
definition (option "P", Pt range) to total energy range definition
(option "E", Energy range).

If NTRACK equal -1 events are read from P input stream instead of
been generated. In this case the second parameter is the initial
event number.
.
Other parameters are use as a filter to select particles fed into
simulations. When used as filter, GKINE command should preceed
file openning command.

>Guidance
Open an input or output data file with events.

 Stream. Different I/O streams are:
  P      - physics events input stream
  B      - background events to pile up on top of physics events,
  I      - general input data (no geometry record in the beginning),
  O      - output data.

 Data types may be:
 ' ' - Standard GENZ Zebra format with Lrec=8100 (default),
  Z  - Standard GEANT FZ format with Lrec=900 words,
  L  - Records include Length (Fortran-type OPEN used),
  F  - Fatmen catalog used to access Zebra tapes,
  N  - special Colomn Wise Ntuple with GENZ-type events for input,
  U  - user defined data type. In this case user has to supply his own
       routines AGUSREAD(ier) and to link it dinamically using gexec.
       The input file is opened by default on unit 20 as FORMATTED.
       For a user-specific file openning user has to provide his own
       routine AGUSOPEN(file) and to link it dinamically using gexec.
  1  - read only till the first ZEBRA End_of_file
       (default is a multy-file input stream),
  C  - do not merge splitted or piled-up subevents, keep them in a chain
       (by default they are automatically merged in a single event).
  S  - Special event, i.e. First resulting pile-up event is saved 
       as a permanent pile-up HIT bank.
       Such event, saved once with a maximum pile-up needed, will be added on
       top of normal mixed pile-up events to get huge pile-up in a fast way.
  M  - Multiple try to bypass latency of mass storage. Do not use this option
       if you are not sure the file is there.
  W  - Wildcard numbers, i.e. all digits within the filename are sequentially
       incremented to find valid filenames. The path part is not modified. 
  T  - LisT driven input, i.e. this is the lisT if input files to loop over. 

File: is the name of the data file.
It may include directory path and wildcard characters.
Default extensions for the default file name are P, B and O.

 Sets: list of data sets to be read or written:	
 G - GEANT detector geometry plus DETM bank
     (unless they are already loaded or created)
 E - GENZ RUNT/EVNT banks with parton level information,
 K - Geant KINE/VERT/HEAD information,
 H - HIT banks,
 D - DIGI banks,
 R - reconstruction banks,
 * - all above (default, NO SIMULATION will be done!).

 Note:
 (1) GEANT simulations are allowed ONLY if the input does not contain
hits or digits (i.e. simulations are disallowed by the default list!).
 (2) Internal data structure description (rz-database) is always updated
automatically on P stream.
To force a manual update use STRUCTURES command with 2 blank arguments.
To prevent the rz-database update, use I-input stream with sequential
TRIG comand.
To update include files use the default STRUCTURES commands.

>Guidance
Open a histogram output file. This file is used to keep
disk resident N-tuples and to save all histograms at the end
of run.
Default parameters allows maximum file length about 4 Gbytes
(30 times more then a standard HBOOK file). Note, that most
UNIX systems still limit the filesize below 2Gbytes.

 Before opening a disk resident N-tuple, user should do
 the following directory setting:

    Call RZCDIR('//SLUGRZ',' ')
    Call  HCDIR('//SLUGRZ',' ')

 At the end of the run you should do EXIT command to finish GEANT -
 this will do the actual histogram saving.

>Guidance

Produce a definition file with data structure description and
update the documentation database (detm.rz) in accordance with the
structures currenly loaded in the program.

System name argument is interpreted in the same way as the argument in
the UNIX 'ls' command, for example:
 - no name at all produces a single output file (detmsys)
with all structure descriptions in it;
 - '*' produces a set of system-based output files (*sys)
with its related structure description;
 - sys/name produces a single structure definition.

Type of the output may be

  def   - AGI preprocessor input file (default),
  idl   - CORBA interface definitions language,
  other - internal table format

The detmsys.def output may be automatically read by the AGI parser so that user
can get access to structure description with +cde or +include statements.
CORBA idl file should be processed by STIC compiler to produce .inc and .h
files. Internal definition file is directly fed to table access module.

>Guidance
Makes AGI structures, which belong to a particular AGI system, visible as
StaF tables in the requested dataset. Apropriate STAF table descriptions
is derived from AGI description and actual table adresses are mapped to AGI
structures. Default value means "all system".
A subset of structures can also be convertes into tables
by defining the path to them.

By default, all tables are created in /dui/Run, but
destination can be redirectded to another dataset.
If the dataset does not exist yet, it will be created
(but not the whole path!)

counter 'number of faults to catch '                       I D=1
handler 'name of an optional user error handler routine'   C D=' '

>Guidance.

Catch certain number of arithmetic faults of selected type and print
tracing diagnostic. To provide a meaningful diagnostic, user code should
be compiled with '-g' option (unfortunatly, not all of the cernlib
routines are compiled with it!).

 - fault parameter:

List of possible fault types is computer dependant.
Here we describe the HPUX version only, which can detect:
(I) - illegal instruction, (D) - division by 0,
(O) - floating overflow, (U) - floating underflow,  and (X) - inexact numbers.
Last two happens very often and should not be normally considered as errors.
In addition (*) subsitutes all five flags, (+) means do not alter flags other
then mentioned in the command, which otherwise are reset to IGNORE.
If a fault type was never mentioned in any ONFAULT commands and they all
had +'s, corresponding error handler is still activated with the default
behaviour defined in libm.a.

 - counter meaning:

A positive counter sets the number of extended error messages to be printed,
the rest is counted in the common block /agerrorcount/ nnum(5),mmax(5),
but not reported. Error handler is permanently activated.

A zero counter forces the program to simulate a kuip break after the error
message is printed. If this happens in a macro, executed on a kuip prompt,
the kuip will issue the prompt again. If this happens in macro started in
a command line, program will stop.

If the counter is negative, corresponding faults are completely ignored
(not even counted).

 - handler:

If defined, a user handler routine is called instead of the
standard CERNLIB tracing routine.

>Command REBANK
>Guidance

Bank access mechanism is implemeted as it is described in the
Atlas note SOFT-NO-002. The only correction to the note is the call
to the REBANK itself, which now has an additional parameter Ia:

          call REBANK (Path,IDN,Npar,Link*,Ia*)

The returned value of Ia contains the displacement in the bank,
for a single raw request. Remember that this routine is not intended
for general usage and should be avoided - use FILL/USE operators or
RBSTORE/RBCOPY, RBGET/RBPUT routines instead.
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Command FILL
>Guidance

FILL operatore is fully described in the AGI manual (Atlas note SOFT-NO-14).
Here we provide some additional details and helpful hints.

 Although names of the variables in AGI structures are limited to 12
characters, DZDOC suports only 8 characters in the documentation.
That means that in the structure defintion, produced by AGI (see also
STRUCTURES and TABLES commands), all names will be TRUNCATED to 8 symbols.
To avoid this complification, user is advised to use in structures
variable names not longer than 8 charactes.

>Action AGXUSER
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Command USE
>Guidance

Here we provide some general guidance in addition to the Atlas note
SOFT-NO-014, for using USE operator in the reconstruction code.

 the complete format of the USE operator is

 USE Path [ variable=value ] [ OPER={DELETE/UNIQUE/NEXT/ZERO} ] [ STAT=istat ]

All fields apart from Path are optional.

  Path : is the Unix-like path to the selected bank or a chain of banks
         It may include after bank names integer indeces
         If omitted, default value for index is supposed to be 1.

         The Path may be absolute, i.e. starting from /DETM or /RECB, in
         which case the selected bank becomes the Current Working Directory
         or relative, i.e. starting from the current working directory,
         selected by the previous USE operator.
         Module names in the begining of the path are recognized as
         the absolute path in DETM tree.

  OPER:  Different operations are :
   DELETE - deletes the selected bank from the tree AFTER copying its
            content in the corresponding structure
   ZERO   - reset the bank content to ZERO (agaim AFTER coping)
   UNIQUE - moves the selected bank to the first position in the chain
            and drops all other banks in this chain making a unique
            version available for the further analysis.
   NEXT   - select the next bank in the chain without searching the
            path again. If STAT option is used, this is done only
            if the status control variable is OK [0], otherwise
            a normal search in the path is done, thus allowing
            to select a starting bank and its descendent in the
            same USE

  STAT=ISTAT returns in ISTAT the bank access status (0 if OK).
             Initial value of ISTAT should be defined with a DATA statement.

If structure description in the program is different from the one in ZEBRA
memory, local copy is filled correctly using documentation. New variables,
not present in the bank, are left intact.

 Example: suppose a bank has been created by the following module:
 --------
      module    somegeo is a system
      author    me
      created   today
      integer   iprin
      structure MFLG { version, int Bfield(2,3), RmaxInn, ZmaxInn ,char title}
      fill MFLG(1)                  !  system data
          version =1                   !  bank version
          Bfield  = {1,2; 4,5; 11,12}  !  some field value
          RmaxInn = 100                !  max rad
          ZmaxInn = 200                !  max len
          title   = 'abcdef'           !  some 4-letter text
      end

 Then you try to read it with the following subroutine:
 -----
      subroutine sometest
      integer   iprin,istat/0/,i
      structure MFLG { int version, char title, int aaa,
                       Bfield(3,2), RmaxInn, ZmaxInn }
      begin
      mflg_aaa  = 999
      use  SOMEGEO/MFLG
      print *, ' version, aaa, ZmaxInn, title, Bfield: '
      print *,mflg_version,mflg_aaa,mflg_ZmaxInn,' ',mflg_title,mflg_Bfield
      end

 Result will be the following:
 ------
 Schema evolution for Bpath=/DETM/SOME/MFLG* bank=MFLG:
  version, aaa, ZmaxInn, title, Bfield:
   2  999    200.000 abcd    1.00000    2.00000  0.    4.00000    5.00000  0.

GENZ is a package for the handling of the events, sets of particles
and partons, as output by physics event generators.
It has been written for by Robert DeWolf in 1990-1992 and is
fully described in the GENZ manual (1).
The version, described here, maintains the complete functionality
of the original package, but reflects the nature of its usage
and the experience within ATLAS.



GENZ provides tools to access any component of generator
events from  user's code.
Particle data, identities, 4-momenta, vertex position, etc., as well as
the relational information between particles, is readily available.

GENZ provides also a means of reading and writing generator events
stored in the HEPEVT common block (2).

In addition, GENZ provides an a nice event dumping utility for listing
the current event to the standard output.


GENZ was designed as a slave package, hence it is initialised
by the framework itself within avalable ZEBRA memory.
All input/output is also initialised and performed by the
framework itself (see GFILE commands)

Following the general logic, all input events are connected
to a single primary link, with the identification preserved
inside banks, so the first parameter in each call (ILINK)
in never used.

However, to preserve code re-usabilty, we still keep ALL
parameters as they are described in the original manual.

*** Attention **** The only ATLAS-specific change in parameters,
which differs from the GENZ manual, concerns subroutine GNZGETP,
where an extra parameter (VRTX) was added on request from Daniel.

 The subroutine calls that are of interest to GENZ users are given here.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 CALL GNZPRIN(ILINK,LEVEL)

The contents of the current GENE/GENP banks are printed
in a nice format, making this a useful event dump utility.
The contents of the GENR bank are printed if there has been
a new run since the last GNZPRIN call.


 CALL GNZTOHC(IRET)

 Information in the GENZ banks is translated into HEPEVT common block


 Get Run Information

 CALL GNZGETR(ILINK,JIDGN,IGRUN,IGTIM,IGDAT,CMACH,CGENE,VRGEN,IDATG,VRGNZ,VRZEB)

 Get Particle Information:

 GNZGETP(ILINK,IDN,IP,ISTAT,IDPDG,P,AMASS,MOTH,TIME,IDAU1,VERT)

Return information from the particle record specified by ILINK,IDN,IP.
If particle record does not exist, (or if ISTAT = 0),
returned ISTAT is equal to zero.

 Input Parameters

 Get vertex information ???:

 CALL GNZGETV(ILINK,IDN,IP,VSTAR,IMVRT,PRET,AROT,ROTMA)

 Obtain the start point of a particle specified by ILINK,IDN,IP.
 This is found by tracing back from particle IP until zero time

 The index of the particle decaying at the returned vertex point is
returned in IMVRT.
This may not be the immeditate mother particle of IP,
which can be found by calling GNZGETP.
It is rather the first particle in the ancestor traceback.
IMVRT is also used as an error flag for bad input argument values
and other errors.
In these cases, there is always accompanying printout.

 The remaining output parameters are of interest to users who
have set a (uniform) magnetic field using GNZPARR.  ???
PRET is the 3-momentum of particle IP rotated according to the
deflections of its ancestor particles in the field.
AROT is the accumulated angle of rotation in radians about the magnetic field
axis up to but not including IP's flight.  ROTMA returns the rotation matrix
that can be used to rotate 3-vectors, for instance using the utility GNZROTA.

 Input Parameters

Show or change the Intel Processor Control Word using the fortran interface
( Courtesy of Anders Waananen and Jorgen Beck Hansen ):

 FPUGETCW(CW)    : Get the FPU control word in CW
 FPUSETCW(CW)    : Set the FPU control word from CW
 FPUSTACK(FPUTAG,FPUSTATUS,FPUUSED,FPUOVERFLOW) : where
     FPUTAG      : FPU TAG
     FPUSTATUS   : FPU status word
     FPUUSED     : Number of stack registers used. 0 is OK.
     FPUOVERFLOW : 0 = OK, 1 = Stack overflow occurred (FPUUSED>8).

The Intel FPU Control word allows to get the program interupted on various
arithmetics conditions. By default, all interrupts are masked. Resetting 
of some of the mask bits allows for more vigorous arithmetics testing. 
We recommend to set the Control Word at least to 1563 to react on 
Zero Division and Overflow.
If no parameters are given, the FPU Control word and FPU Stack Status
as shown above are printed. 
As calling FPUSTACK affects the FPU control word by setting 
the lowest 7 bits incidentally disabling all interrupts (Why?),
we get CW before and then re-set it after FPUSTACK is called.

More details can be found in  /usr/include/fpu_control.h or running
"info -f g77 Trouble Missing Floating" or in Intel reference manuals.
The following is an abstract from fpu_control.
