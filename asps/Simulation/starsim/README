  atgeant  - atlsim processors and atlsim self-documentation support
  agzio    - atlsim I/O processors and gnz emulation
  atutil   - tracking support (former irecon)
  rebank   - base memory managment 
  include  - ditto

  comis    - comis shared library support, often missing in cern releases
  deccc    - auxilary c-interfaces

Few hints for the begginer:
---------------------------
If you are just a user and whant to run a "dice" type job with everything
comming from a selected version of the official ATLAS libraries, use 
job/atlsim_dice.exe as the example

If you are a developper and are going to modifier ATLAS code, use
job/atlsim_simple.exe as the example

If you are an exprienced use aiming to develop a lot of code or doing
non-standard exercice, please read the documentation in doc.

Bonne chance!
