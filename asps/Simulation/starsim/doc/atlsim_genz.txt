Using GENZ routines from atlsim

You can call some GENZ routines directly from your analysis module running
in atlsim. These `built-in' routines are

   * GNZGETG,
   * GNZGETE,
   * GNZGETP,
   * GEPCODE and
   * GNZPDAT

getting gate, event, particle information and translating particle data from
PDG to GEANT and back. In principle this is all one needs to extract
information from GENZ banks.

If you find you need or want other GENZ routines, the best solution for now
at least is to get a copy of the source code for that routine translated
into the age language, and load it dynamically, before you load your
analysis module which calls it.

For example, here is GNZTOHC which you can load dynamically, if you want to
perform the analysis on HEPEVNT. GNZTOHC could in principle be installed in
atlsim permanently, but this will immediately mean that the HEPEVNT size
should be fixed to the same 10000 value in all potential user analysis
routines, which was one of the permanent problems with GENZ.

If you want to use some GENZ routine(s) other than the ones listed above
from atlsim, please contact me (Jo Pater) and I will see about getting you
the age source.
