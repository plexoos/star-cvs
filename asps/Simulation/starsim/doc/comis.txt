03.10.2003  - paw - comis call sequences


paw: fortran/Call -> pafort.F ->
     if no param ->  CSJCAL(entry in CSJCALL.F) ->  CSPMDx+CSJCAX
     else            CSJSUB(entry in CSSUBR.F)  ->  CSPMDx+CSPCLL
     => CSINT1->CSINTX->CSKCAL->cscalr.c

  -  Both CSJCAX and CSPCLL allocate frames for comis pseudocode and call CSINT1
  -  CSINT1 takes care of re-entrace by saving 8 "pointers" in  MRECU
  -  CSINTX is the pseudocode interpreter: Np*<45:par> + <87:call> + <113:exit>
  -  CSKCAL makes parameter re-counting                        
  -  cscalr/a.c makes jmp as address de-refference 

Problems:
     CSJCAX allocated just a sinlge frame, so was not reentrant - fixed
     CSKCAL was doing pointer shift with a local NPAR _after_ calls.
            with 2002 version of cernlib NPAR is a static variable!
            I move pointer update _before_ calls.
