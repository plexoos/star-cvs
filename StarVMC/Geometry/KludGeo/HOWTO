HOWTO create a kludge geometry correction
_____________________________________________________________________________________

A kludge geometry can be applied to select geometry models.  Contact the 
S&C team if you think you need to do this for a given geometry tag.

By default, even if the kludge geometry is present in a geometry model it will
not perform any actions.  You need to enable it.

Running starsim directly, you would execute the following kuip commands.  (If you
are running it w/in the root4star framework, you'll want to use the command("...")
function to pass the commands to starsim).

The following command will create two 0.5cm disks centered at z=-100 cm and +100 cm,
with inner radii of 5 and 10cm, and outer radii of 10 and 20 cm.

DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=2 ktub.z=-100 +100 ktub.dz=0.5 0.5 ktub.rmn=5.0 10.0 ktub.rmx=10.0 20.0

You can also specify material properties.  The following creates a 1mm cylinder
shell of carbon (with density of carbon fiber) extending from -400 to +100 cm 
with radius of 10cm

DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=1 ktub.z=-150.0 ktub.dz=250.0 ktub.rmn=9.95 ktub.rmx=10.05 aa=12.0 zz=6.0 dd=1.70


You may crete up to 10 tubes which are centered on and parallel to the z-axis.


After executing the DETP command, you should build the geometry as usual...

example:
cp $STAR/StarVMC/Geometry/macros/loadAgML.C
starsim

> DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=1 ktub.z=-150.0 ktub.dz=250.0 ktub.rmn=9.95 ktub.rmx=10.05 aa=12.0 zz=6.0 dd=1.70
> loadAgML y2015a


If you run within the root4star framework, the DETP command should be issued before
the first call to trig...


// Add this line just before the first "trig" command
command("DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=2 ktub.z=-100 +100 ktub.dz=0.5 0.5 ktub.rmn=5.0 10.0 ktub.rmx=10.0 20.0");
trig(1);
