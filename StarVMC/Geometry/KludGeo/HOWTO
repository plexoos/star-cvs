HOWTO create a kludge geometry correction
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Use Case:

Systematic studies of material uncertainties.

Implemenation:

KludGeo allows users to place up to 10 tubes, with some restrictions, into 
existing geometry tags during the simulation phase in order to estimate 
the effects of uncertainties in the geometry setup.

The restrictions on the tubes are that they can only be placed centered on
the z-axis, and they must lay parallel to the z-axis.  Otherwise, the 
length, thickness and material may all be determined by the user.

One should take care to avoid placing the tubes overlapping with other geometry
objects, otherwise they may interfere with each other and cause unexpected
tracking behavior.

HOWTO:

A kludge geometry can be applied to select geometry models.  Contact the 
S&C team if you think you need to do this for a given geometry tag.  It
is currently enabled for the y2014 - y2016 production geometries.

By default, even if the kludge geometry is present in a geometry model it will
not perform any actions.  You need to enable it.

Running starsim directly, you would execute the following kuip commands.  
(If you are running it w/in the root4star framework, you'll want to use the 
command("...") function to pass the commands to starsim).

The following command will create two 0.5cm disks centered at z=-100 cm and 
+100 cm, with inner radii of 5 and 10cm, and outer radii of 10 and 20 cm.

DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=2 ktub.z=-100 +100 ktub.dz=0.5 0.5 ktub.rmn=5.0 10.0 ktub.rmx=10.0 20.0

You can also specify material properties.  The following creates a 1mm cylinder
shell of carbon (with density of carbon fiber) extending from -400 to +100 cm 
with radius of 10cm

DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=1 ktub.z=-150.0 ktub.dz=250.0 ktub.rmn=9.95 ktub.rmx=10.05 aa=12.0 zz=6.0 dd=1.70

You may crete up to 10 tubes which are centered on and parallel to the z-axis.

After executing the DETP command, you should build the geometry as usual...

NOTE:  During geometry construction, you should see printouts indicating
that the tubes have been placed in the geometry.


Example:

cp $STAR/StarVMC/Geometry/macros/loadAgML.kumac
starsim

starsim> DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=1 ktub.z=-150.0 ktub.dz=250.0 ktub.rmn=9.95 ktub.rmx=10.05 aa=12.0 zz=6.0 dd=1.70
starsim> loadAgML y2015a

To visualize the detector configuration, you can do the following.  First, export the geometry to an rz file.

starsim> grfile y2015a_kludge.rz
starsim> exit

Next, convert to ROOT CINT macro and execute it 

$ g2root y2015a_kludge.rz
$ root y2015a_kludge.C

Finally, draw the geometry.  

root [0] gGeoManager->FindVolumeFast("CAVE")->Draw("ogl")




If you run within the root4star framework, the DETP command should be issued before
the first call to trig...


// Add this line just before the first "trig" command
command("DETP KLUD kcfg.ntube=2 ktub.z=-100 +100 ktub.dz=0.5 0.5 ktub.rmn=5.0 10.0 ktub.rmx=10.0 20.0");
trig(1);
