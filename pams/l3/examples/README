l3/local
========

This directory contains examples on how to run the l3 tracker.

STANDALONE PROGRAMS
+++++++++++++++++++

sl3StandAlone.cxx is an example of an standalone program
reading from an ascii file. The executable "sl3A" is generated
with "make sl3A". By default it reads the file
"TpcSectorOneForAuAuCentralHijing.txt" containing the information
of a TPC sector for a Central AuAu Hijing event. This is our
canonical TPC sector for time tests.

sl3Daq.cc is an example of reading a binary file with the cluster
DAQ format. The executable "sl3Daq" is generated with
"make sl3Daq". By default it reads the file
"/afs/rhic.bnl.gov/star/users/yepes/try/cos_B1.dta".

To generate these two executables the compilation flag -D SL3ROOT
should NOT be used. See inside the Makefile file.

ROOT and Graphic Interface
=========================

The graphic subdirectory contains a simple graphic package to be
used with ROOT. Hopefully this could be replaced with a more
elaborated graphic package. It is possible to create a shared
library by typing "make FtfSl3.so". However before doing that
the compilation flag should include the following:
"-D SL3ROOT -I$(ROOTSYS)/include". FtfSl3.so is a shared library
which can be loaded from root. An example macro using this library is:

readJpsi.cxx:   reads a file with one j/psi decaying into muons.
                Notice each track has produced up to three hits per
		row so there are more than 2 tracks reconstructed.

After running this macro (.x readJPsi.cxx from root prompt)
the detector is displayed with hits and tracks. The mouse can 
be used to rotate the detector. The following
commands are available:

tracker.plotDetector()    
tracker.plotHits()
tracker.plotTracks()    plots hits in tracks connected by line
tracker.plotFits()      plots helices

The hits and tracks are accesible from root for inspection or
filling histograms or ntuples.
