In the last few days I have added the following modules:

tpcHit2L3Hit:
    It converts tcl_tphit tables to the online buffer in table sl3Buffer 
l3Hit2TpcHit:
    It converts the online buffer (in a sl3Buffer type table) to tcl_tphit
sl3Tpc:
   It does the tracking for a sector with online input and output (both
stored in sl3Buffer tables).

A number of auxiliary routines and classes have been added:
- In inc directory:
   -l3Point.h 
   -t2l.h 
   -t2lConstants.h
   -The online table formats have also been added in this directory as *.h files.
- l3cl
   -t2l.cc
 
At this point the TPC geometry constants used by l3Point.h are stored in t2lConstants.h. 
This is not an elegant approach and should be changed. However for now I chose to
get something running and fix it when time allows. tpcHit2L3Hit and
l3Hit2TtpcHit have as input the table l3Geom that contains TPC geometry information.
However the geometry info from l3Geom is not used at the moment.

   The above modules have been tested with a standalone macro: l3StandAlone.cxx, that
should be in the doc directory.
