<p>STAR TPC detector simulation software is required to simulate
the response of the TPC detector volume and its electronics to
the passage of charged particles through the TPC volume, including
those from pp, pA and AA collisions.  The STAR TPC Fast Simulator
(TFS) has been designed to generate a large volume of event samples
simulating the response of the TPC and the performance of the
TPC hit reconstruction algorithm. 
<P>
A GEANT Monte Carlo program takes tracks from an event generator
and propagates them through the TPC, generating hits corresponding
to each pad-row crossing.  These GEANT hits are fed into the TFS
as input.  TFS assigns each GEANT hit a characteristic signal
width 
(<img src="sigma.gif" alt="sigma"><sub><i>prf</i></sub>)
in the transverse plane and a spatial resolution 
(<img src="sigma.gif" alt="sigma"><sub><i>z</i></sub>)
in the drift direction.  The parametrization of 
<img src="sigma.gif" alt="sigma"><sub><i>prf</i></sub>
and 
<img src="sigma.gif" alt="sigma"><sub><i>z</i></sub>
depend upon the
intrinsic pad response, the drift length, track pad crossing angle,
sense wire spacing, transverse and longitudinal diffusion of the
TPC gas, electronics shaping time and sampling frequency.  Then
the hits are smeared about the known GEANT hit position according
to a gaussian distribution function whose width is given by the
<img src="sigma.gif" alt="sigma"><sub><i>prf</i></sub>
 parametrization. Those hits which are then found to overlap in
both the pad plane projection and the drift direction are merged
to form larger single hit clusters. Hits in the same pad-row are
merged when their separation 
<img src="Delta.gif" alt="Delta"> satisfies the condition

<P>
and
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="eq2.gif">
<P>
This condition places a cut-off on the deconvolution of close
hits related to the expected performance of the hit reconstruction
algorithm.  Merged hits whose combined spatial width is smaller
than 10 pad widths and 20 time bins are preserved and written
to the output along with the isolated hits. The output of TFS
then forms the input of the STAR TPC tracking system.
<P>
TFS has been written with flexibility in mind.  It is controlled
by parameter files for easy modification of the TPC running conditions.
 TFS is  capable
of merging events prior to and following the triggered event.
 This is particularly important in the high-luminosity environment
of proton-proton collisions where non-triggered events will be
registered during the time that the TPC volume is read out.
