tte     pams/tpc/tte       # sakrejda     07/28/93 13:14:27 Evaluation of the 
reconstruction.

It consists of two modules :
tte.F         - tracking(tpt) package evaluation
tte_hit_match - a module that matches geant and reconstructed hits
                the first step on a way towards the hit finder evaluation.

tte_mit_match.c:
===============

All the geant hits are sorted according to the volume_id, so all the hits
from the pseudo-padrows end up at the end (the sorting is in the increasing 
order).

All the reconstructed hits are sorted on the row word (100*sector_row).

The matching routine goes through all the geant hits from real padrows.
For every geant hit it finds the best match that is there but is not further
than LIMIT (4cm now) in z and not further than sqrt(DIST_MAX) in 3d.
DIST_MAX is right now 20.0 cm**2.

The results are stored in the index table. The type word is set to 
tpc_index_type[0].tphit_mhitstpc. key1 is set to the geant hit ID.  
key2 is set to the reconstructed hit ID.
If no match is found, key2 is set to 0.

Two geant hits can be matched to the same reconstructed hit. 
For the time being nothing is done for the reconstructed hits that are not
matched. One could use the flag word of the reconstructed hit to mark it 
as matched and then later add all the unmarked hits to the index table, 
but I have not done that yet.
