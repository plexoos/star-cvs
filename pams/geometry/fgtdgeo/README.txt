Revision 1.1  2007/02/07 23:55:09  potekhin
As an additional piece of documentation, necesary
due to the code re-shuffle and decomissioing, added
a readme to this branch of geometry


February 2007 -- all subsequent pieces of code in this
directory will describe a different detector, formerly
known as IGT. It is also GEM based, but covers a much
smaller area and is a part of the central tracker.
Previous versions of what was known as FGT before
will be decomissioned.

This is done with the goal to have a consistent naming
scheme in STAR Monte Carlo.
