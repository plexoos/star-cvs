Hi Victor,
I have placed my private version of UPGR16 geometry in the directory:
/star/data05/scratch/balewski/fgt-geo-ver2.2
The only file I have changed is:
pams/geometry/fgtdgeo/fgtdgeo1.g

to try it execute
starsim> exe e

Few snapshots  of UPGR16 are posted at
http://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/system/files/aa.pdf


Would it be possible you inspect it and fix all problems I'm aware of  
and those I'm not.
Here is the list if the issues I know :

1) file name is wrong, should be fgtdgeo2.g

2) geometry version is hardcoded
   USE FGTG  config=2
Could you arrange it as it should be.
BTW,
UPGR16 has 3 possible configurations:
  1 = just FGT outer cone, no disks
  2 = cone + 6 regular disks
  3 =  cone + 6 regular disks + 3 extra disks for study of forward  
tracking at rapidity above 2
I'd like  config=3 to be the default.

3) UPGR16 contains also several supporting disks, cables for  
HFT,IST,SSD,  TPC resistor chain.
This stuff does not belong to FGT, can be moved to other .g files if  
you wish - just so it shows up in UPGR16.

3.1)
All those volumes are added with the flag
  kOnly='MANY'
I just copied what was in UPGR15 - please change as needed

4) The beam pipe is not fully implemented, it stops at Z of ~100 cm. I  
inherited this from UPGR15.
The later section of the beam pipe  was probably part of the old West  
cone, removed from UPGR15.
  Could you please restore the old pipe , starting at Z where the new  
beam pipe ends ?

5)  I'd like to subdivide sensitive area (disks) on to 4 quadrants, as  
shown on the 4th plot (in PDF).
  Block FGSC
.......
The division lines are at phi =-15 deg and +75 deg.  Could you do it  
for me?

6)  I have implemented total of 9 FGT disks, numbered in a bit  
irregular way:
http://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/system/files/Picture+18_4.png

Wei-Ming is now testing this geometry with single particles and we see  
hits from disks 1,..,8, but never from the 9th disk.  This disk is so  
large and sits up front - it always should see a hit. Could you have a  
look what I did wrong?

Those are all problems I found so far.
I'd hope we could agree on the following sequence of events:
* if you could inspect and correct all problems in this geometry from  
STAR soft-team perspective.
* I'll prepare more detailed writeup and test further material  
distribution with Geant,
* Wei-Ming will work on changes in g2t_fgt.F  code .
Once we are all ~done, I'll take your version and add my last minute  
corrections.
Next, you will cvs ci UPGR16 to CVS and Wei-Ming will cvs ci g2t_fgt.F .

Does this sound reasonable?
Hope we can get it done within a week or so.

Thanks
Jan
