     Welcome to the Fast Multiplicity Generator Code  
     -----------------------------------------------

This page was last updated on Nov. 8, 1999.

A general description of the method, algorithm and input is given 
in file 'mevsim.doc'

An input file for generating VENUS central Au+Au 200 AGeV like events is 
in 'mult_gen_venus-like.in' and for VINI like events is in the file
'mult_gen_vini-like.in.'  These use Ron Longacre's parameters which were
determined by fitting the pt,y distributions from these generators.

The source code is contained in 2 files: mevsim.F and multiplicity_gen.F
which were updated on 11/8/99 along with the include file multi_gen.inc.
