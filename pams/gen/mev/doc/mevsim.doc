CCC   Documentation and Description:
CCC
C     This code is intended to provide a quick means of producing
C     uncorrelated simulated events for event-by-event studies,
C     detector acceptance and efficiency studies, etc.  The
C     user selects the number of events, the one-particle distribution
C     model, the particles to include, the ranges in transverse
C     momentum, pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, the mean
C     multiplicity for each particle type for the event run, the
C     mean temperature, Rapidity width, etc., and the standard deviations
C     for the event-to-event variation in the model parameters.
C    
C     The user may select either to have the same multiplicity per
C     particle type for each event or to let the multiplicity vary
C     randomly according to a Poisson distribution.  Similarly the
C     parameters of the one-particle distribution models may either
C     be fixed to the same value for each event or allowed to randomly
C     vary about a specified mean with a specified standard deviation
C     and assuming a Gaussian distribution.
C
C     The input is from a file, named 'mult_gen.in'.  The output is
C     particle table for a given event.
C     Header information is store in the first particle. Event header 
C     information store in the first particle includes: Impact parameter
C     and phi angle of collision; Generator number 62 mev giving VENUS
C     like central collision and number 80 giving VNI like central; 
C     Energy per nucleon-nucleon collision; Colliding system A.A;
C     Run number; Event number; Day; and Time. 
C     A log file, 'mult_gen.log' is also written which contain config. 
C     messages.
C
C     The method for generating random multiplicities and model parameter
C     values involves the following steps:
C        (1) The Poisson or Gaussian distributions are computed and
C            loaded into function f().
C        (2) The distribution f(x') is integrated from xmin to x
C            and saved from x = xmin to x = xmax.  The range and mesh
C            spaces are specified by the user.
C        (3) The integral of f is normalized to unity where 
C            integral[f(x')](at x = xmin) = 0.0
C            integral[f(x')](at x = xmax) = 1.0
C        (4) A random number generator is called which delivers values
C            between 0.0 and 1.0.  
C        (5) We consider the coordinate x (from xmin to xmax) to be
C            dependent on the integral[f].  Using the random number
C            for the selected value of integral[f] the value of x
C            is obtained by interpolation.
C
C     An interpolation subroutine from Rubin Landau, Oregon State Univ.,
C     is used to do this interpolation; it involves uneven mesh point 
C     spacing.
C
C     The method for generating the particle momenta uses the
C     standard random elimination method and involves the following
C     steps:
C        (1) The transverse momentum (pt) and pseudorapidity (eta) are 
C            randomly chosen within the specified ranges.
C        (2) The one-particle model distribution is calculated at this
C            point and its ratio to the maximum value throughout the
C            (pt,eta) region is calculated.
C        (3) Another random number is called and if less than the ratio
C            from step(2) the particle momentum is used; if not then
C            another trial value of (pt,eta) is obtained.
C        (4) This continues until the required multiplicity for the 
C            specific event and particle type has been satisfied.
C        (5) This process is repeated for the requested number of particle
C            types and events. 
C
C     Problematic parameter values are tested, bad input values are checked
C     and in some cases may be changed so that the program will not crash.
C     In some cases the code execution is stopped.
C     Some distributions and/or unusual model parameter values may cause the
C     code to hang up due to the poor performance of the "elimination"
C     method for very strongly peaked distributions.  These are tested for
C     certain problematic values and if necessary these events are aborted.
C     A message, "*** Event No.    2903 ABORTED:" for example is printed
C     in the 'mult_gen.out' file.  Temperatures .le. 0.01 GeV and rapidity
C     width parameters .le. 0.01 will cause the event to abort.
C
C     The input is described below in the 'read' statements and also in
C     the sample input file.  Some additional comments are as follows:
C
C     (1) n_events - Selected number of events in run. Can be anything
C                    .ge. 1.
C     (2) n_pid_type - Number of particle ID types to include in the
C                      particle list. e.g. pi(+) and pi(-) are counted
C                      separately.  The limit is set by parameter npid
C                      in the accompanying include file 'Parameter_values.inc'
C                      and is presently set at 10.
C     (3) model_type - equals 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 so far.  See comments in
C                      Function dNdpty to see what is calculated.

C                        event selection process.  The maximum number of
C                        steps that can be covered is determined by
C                        parameter n_mult_max_steps in the accompanying
C                        include file 'Parameter_values.inc' which is
C                        presently set at 1000, but the true upper limit for
C                        this is n_mult_max_steps - 1 = 999.

C     (9) n_stdev_sigma- Same, except for the rapidity width parameter.

C    (11) n_integ_pts - Number of mesh points to use in the random model
C                       parameter selection process.  The upper limit is
C                       set by parameter nmax_integ in the accompanying
C                       include file 'Parameter_values.inc' which is presently
C                       set at 100, but the true upper limit for n_integ_pts
C                       is nmax_integ - 1 = 99. 
C    (12) n_scan_pts  - Number of mesh points to use to scan the (pt,y)
C                       dependence of the model distributions looking for
C                       the maximum value.  The 2-D grid has
C                       n_scan_pts * n_scan_pts points; no limit to size of
C                       n_scan_pts.
C    (13) irand       - Starting random number seed.
