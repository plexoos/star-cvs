The STARlight Monte Carlo models 2-photon and photon-Pomeron interactions
in peripheral heavy ion collisions.  The physics approach for the 2-photon
interactions is described in STAR Note 243. That for the photon-Pomeron
interactions is described in Klein and Nystrand, Phys. Rev. C60, 014903 (1999),
with the p_t spectrum (including vector meson interference) discussed by
Klein and Nystrand in Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2330 (2000).  

STARlight has several input files, all of which are expected to be in the
same directory as the starlight code.  User-specified input parameters are
read from a file named "starlight.in"; these parameters are described
below. The file "starlight.dat" contains a table of differential
luminosity values.  STARlight checks this file to see whether or not a
change in input parameters requires the values to be recalculated; if so,
this file is over-written with the new values.  If there is no existing 
starlight.dat file, STARlight will produce one.  The data file "jet.dat"
contains modified branching ratios for jetset. 

The output of the STARlight Monte Carlo can be written to an ascii file
named "starlight.out". The format of the text output can be chosen so that
it can be read by GSTAR. Alternatively, the output can be chosen to be
placed in a zipped PAW ntuple (currently the preferred interface with
GSTAR), "evgen.1.nt.gz".  The file can be unzipped and looked at directly
using PAW, or converted to a root file using the h2root utility. (Type
"h2root evgen.1.nt filenameyoulike.root"-- currently this works only in
pro.)

----------------------------
How to use:

   1)  copy contents of src directory to your own src directory

   2)  copy jet.dat and starlight.in from the bin directory into your own
bin directory

   3)  edit the Makefile to use the appropriate lines depending on whether
you are compiling on Linux or Solaris; then type "make" to compile-- the
executable "starlight" will be placed in the bin directory
(there are three places to edit-- one is in choosing the appropriate
include file, another is either including or not the source ludata.F, and
the last is in choosing the appropriate line for the target definition)

   4)  edit starlight.in to reflect your preferred choice of input
parameters-- see starlight.doc in the src directory for an explanation of
input parameters

   5)  in the bin directory, type "starlight" to run; if you selected
either text output format, the output will be written to the file
starlight.out in the bin directory; if you selected ntuple output, the
output will be written to the file evgen.1.nt.gz, and will need to be
unzipped (type "gunzip evgen.1.nt.gz")

The contents of a sample starlight.in file are listed below, with 
explanation.  The user should modify this file according to his or her
needs.

79  197	     // Z, A of the colliding ions (symmetric 
	collisions are assumed)
100	     // gamma for the colliding ions
4.0 -1 50   // maximum and minimum values for w (the gamma-gamma center of mass
	energy, w = 4(E1)(E2), (a -1 tells STARlight to use the default values
	specified in setConst.f; otherwise, specific wmin here, and the number
        of w bins in the lookup tables
3.0 30	// maximum value for y (y is the rapidity, y = 0.5 ln(E1/E2) ) and the 
        number of y-bins in the cross section calculation 
1	// gg or gP switch -- A 1 here will produce 2-photon channels, a
	// 2 here will produce vector meson channels with a narrow
	//resonance, and a 3 here will produce vector meson channels with
	//a wide (Breit-Wigner) resonance.
10000	// number of events to produce
331	// channel of interest (in PDG notation); currently supported
	options listed below
345738	// random number seed
2	// The form of the output.  A 1 here generates a simple text file.  
        '2' generates a text file in the gstar format
        '3' generates a PAW ntuple.
1	// This number controls the nuclear breakup
        // Note that this option only works for lead or gold; it should work at any energy
	1 = hard sphere nuclei (b>2R)
	2 = both nuclei break up (XnXn)
	3 = a single neutron from each nucleus (1n1n)
	4 = require that neither nucleon break up (with b>2R)
	5 = require that there be no hadronic break up
		(This is similar to option 1, but with the actual hadronic interaction
		probability)
1       0 = no interference (i.e. turned off), 1= interference turned on
0.5     when interference is turned on, this gives the %age interference 0= none, 1=full
0.24.   when interference is turned on, this is the maximum pt considered
120     when interference is turned on, this is the number of pt bins
