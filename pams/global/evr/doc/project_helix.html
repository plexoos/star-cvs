C          psi  = azimuthal angle for pt at first point (degrees)
C          q    = particle charge in units of (e)

C                 approached (cm)

C     Output Arguments:
C
C          x(1,2,3,4) = x,y,z coordinates of position on helical track
C                       corresponding to the distance of closest approach
C                       to the line thru point xp(1),xp(2);
C                       x(4) is the azimuthal angle of pt at this point
C                       in degrees.
C          R          = radius of circle projection of helix onto x-y plane (cm)
C          xc(1,2)    = x,y coordinates of center of circle (cm)

C     Description:
C
C          This code finds the position along an arbitrary helix defined
C          by the input parameters (psi,q,pt,tanl,x0,y0,z0,bfld) which
C          is closest to an arbitrary line parallel to the z-axis going
C          thru a point at x=xp(1), y=xp(2).  It is assumed that the DCA
C          point on the helix occurs when the DCA (x,y) point is first
C          reached in going backwards along the helix trajectory from
C          the initial point on the track.  The center of the circle
C          (projection of helix onto x-y plane) is found first, then
C          the DCA point in x,y is located, then the phase angle in the
C          x-y plane from the initial point back to the DCA point is 
C          evaluated, then the z-coord at the DCA point is computed,
C          and finally the azimuthal angle for the pt momentum direction
C          in the x-y plane at the DCA point (i.e. x(4)) is calculated.
