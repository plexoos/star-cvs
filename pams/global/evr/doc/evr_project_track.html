C
C     Input Arguments:
C
C          psi  = azimuthal angle for pt at first point (degrees)
C          q    = particle charge in units of (e)
C          pt   = transverse momentum (GeV/c)
C          tanl = tangent of dip angle at first point
C          x0   = x coordinate of first point (cm)
C          y0   = y coordinate of first point (cm)
C          z0   = z coordinate of first point (cm)
C          bfld = z-component of magnetic field (kilo-gauss)
C          xp   = x & y coordinates of line (parallel to z-axis) to be
C                 approached (cm)
C          LIFC = Radiation length fraction of TPC Inner Field Cage
C                 OR other (e.g. effective SVT first layer) for cases
C                 with SVT and/or SSD space points.
C
C     Output Arguments:
C
C          x(1,2,3,4) = x,y,z coordinates of position on track
C                       corresponding to the distance of closest approach
C                       to the line thru point xp(1),xp(2);
C                       x(4) is the azimuthal angle of pt at this point
C                       in degrees.
C          sigma      = Track position uncertainty estimate at DCA pt. (cm)
C
C     Description:
C
C          This short driver routine determines track curvature and
C          calls the appropriate routine for (sufficiently) curved
C          or straight tracks as needed.  It also estimates the extrap-
C          olated track position uncertainty (sigma) for use in the
C          fitting and error estimate.  This uses the variable trans_pathL
C          where:
C
C          trans_pathL= Transverse (i.e. in x-y plane) path length (cm) along
C                       trajectory from initial point back to the DCA pt.
