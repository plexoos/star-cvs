<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE VERTEX_FIT(NT)</h3>
CC:>--------------------------------------------------------------------
CC:Passed parameters:  NT = number of tracks invloved in the fit
CC:returned param:    
CC:		      Xv,Yv,Zv = the vertex co-ordinants
CC:		      NT = number of tracks used for the vertex fitting
CC:			   (note this variable is passed and returned.)
CC:		       the pointer list is reordered to reflect which
CC:		       tracks were used in the fit
CC:
CC:Description: It performs the least square fit to find a common vertex
CC:for NT tracks whose parameters are stored in the /fitvert/ common.
CC:The vertex information is returned as coordinants.
