<pre><h3> EVR - Package Updates </h3>


 MODIFIED  IN STAF : S. Margetis, December 1998
   Changed input of magnetic field, evr parameters. Now it
        marks by default the vertex tracks.

 MODIFIED TO WORK IN STAF : S. Margetis, November 1996

 MODIFIED TO WORK IN TAS : E. G. Judd, November 1993
   Added switches so the vertex finder can use TPC, SVT or global tracks.
         Also added cuts on pt, and whether or not the track has been
         matched, to improve track selection : E. G. Judd, April 1994

 AUTHORS:     S. Margetis  Created  MARCH-1992
              L. Ray, Modified and Maintained from February 1999 - present

  Modified for greater accepted range in z for vertex position; array
  bounds checking; unused array cleanup; and bug fixes by L. Ray on
  Feb. 22, 1999

  Following modifications by R.L.Ray during May, 1999:
  (1)  Include optional re-calculation of helix track projection and
       distance of closest approach (DCA) determination for new
       vertex position at each iteration.
  
  (2)  Save initial vertex seed position as well as iterations 1 and 2
       values in privert table with iflag values set as noted above.
  
  (3)  Compute primary vertex covariance matrix and save diagonal
       components in table privert.
       CHANGE July 1999: Save complete primary vertex position covariance
                         matrix in privert().covar[6]
  
  (4)  Estimate multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) error contribution to
       the uncertainty (sigma) in the extrapolated track position at the
       DCA point.  Use in vertex fit.  Assumes all tracks are TPC only
       and that MCS in TPC inner field cage is dominant effect.  Uses
       spatial rms MCS angle.  Assumes pion mass for MCS angle calculation
       for all tracks.

       NOTE:  This part will need to be generalized when global tracks
              include SVT tracks and SVT-TPC matched tracks.
       CHANGE July 1999: code checks for SVT or SSD track segments and
                         if these occur an effective SVT radiation 
                         thickness for the first SVT layer is used to
                         estimate the MCS sigma. 
  
  (5)  Modified/corrected helix projection subroutine.
  
  (6)  Include straight track (no B field case) track projection.
  
  (7)  Modified/corrected 3-D DCA subroutine for special case.
  
  (8)  General cleanup and QA verification.
  
  (9)  Use input global track covariance matrix to calculate the
       track position uncertainty at the extrapolated DCA point.
       Use this as an error (sigma) in the i-th track DCA point
       and add in quadrature with the MCS error.
       CHANGE July 1999: Use the Kalman filter/fitter definition; use
                         new global track table (dst_track) with full
                         track fit covariance matrix; use of old
                         globtrk_aux removed.

 (10)  Compute chi-square per track used in fit and save in
       privert().pchi2
       CHANGE July 1999: Compute chi-square per degree of freedom and
                         probability of chi-square and save in
                         privert().chisq(1,2), respectively.

  Additional changes made in July 1999 by R. L. Ray:

 (11)  Use Detector ID and Vertex ID codes defined in $STAR/pams/global/inc/
       StDetectorDefinitions.h and StVertexDefinitions.h

 (12)  Modified code for no magnetic field case.  If abs(Bz).le.0.001 kGauss,
       Bz is set to 0.0.  In order to have some estimate of the MCS error
       an arbitary value of pT = 0.4 GeV/c is assumed.  The charge is also
       assumed to be +1 for the no B field runs.

 (13)  Calculate 3D DCA to final primary vertex for all good global tracks
       and load into globtrk().impact.

 (14)  Modified for new global track parameters r0,phi0 - 9/29/99 (L.Ray)
