C     Input Arguments:
C
C          pt   = transverse momentum (GeV/c)
C          x0   = x coordinate of first point (cm) 
C          y0   = y coordinate of first point (cm) 
C          psi  = azimuthal angle for pt at first point (degrees)
C          tanl = tangent of dip angle at first point
C          trans_pathL = transverse path length (cm) of trajectory
C                        from initial point back to the DCA point.
C          LIFC = Radiation length fraction of TPC Inner Field Cage
C                 OR other, e.g. effective SVT first layer.
C
C     Output:   sigma_estimate = estimated sigma (cm) of position
C                                uncertainty of projected track at
C                                DCA point.

C     Description:
C
C          This code assumes all tracks are either:
C             (1) pure TPC space points only, or
C             (2) have SVT - SSD points.
C          For the former the algorithm assumes the TPC only track  
C          starts near the TPC IFC and that MCS in the TPC-IFC is the
C          dominant effect on the projected track position uncertainty
C          at the DCA point.  This neglects the SVT-SSD contribution
C          to MCS if this detector material is present.  This could be
C          of order half the position error squared from the TPC-IFC.
C          The beam pipe contribution is negligible for a beryllium pipe. 
C          
C          For tracks with SVT and/or SSD space points the algorithm
C          assumes the track's first point is in the first layer of the
C          SVT and uses an effective radiation length fraction of one-third
C          of the total of 5% (latter amount from GSTAR geometry and material
C          plots - 1999).  The beam pipe contribution is negligible
C          for a beryllium pipe.  The actual path length from the initial
C          point on the track (in any SVT layer or in the SSD 4th layer)
C          to the extrapolated DCA point is used however.
C          
C          In both cases the position uncertainty is assumed to be the
C          spatial rms MCS angle uncertainty [sqrt(2.0)*theta_0] times
C          the path length.
