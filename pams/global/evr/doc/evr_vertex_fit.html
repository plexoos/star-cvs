<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE EVR_VERTEX_FIT(NT)
</h3>
CC:>--------------------------------------------------------------------
CC:Passed parameters:  NT = number of tracks involved in the fit
CC:returned param:    
CC:                   Xv,Yv,Zv = the vertex co-ordinants
CC:                   NT = number of tracks used for the vertex fitting
CC:                        (note this variable is passed and returned.)
CC:                    the pointer list is reordered to reflect which
CC:                    tracks were used in the fit
CC:
CC:Description: It performs the least square fit to find a common vertex
CC:for NT tracks whose parameters are stored in the /fitvert/ common.
CC:The vertex information is returned as coordinants.

CC:Written by Daniel Cebra
CC:Modified for STAR by S. Margetis
CC: Modified by R. L. Ray, May 1999, add errors and clean-up unused 
CC: stuff.  Add calculation of error covariance matrix for 3D vertex
CC: position.  The cov(1,2...6) matrix is defined by:
CC:
CC:           cov(#) |   x   y   z
CC:           ----------------------
CC:              x   |   1
CC:              y   |   2   3
CC:              z   |   4   5   6
CC:           ----------------------
CC:
CC: Also the Chi-Square of the fit is computed and returned to the
CC: calling program via the common block /VERTEX/.
CC:
CC:   Status:   Testing in May, 1999, Done.
