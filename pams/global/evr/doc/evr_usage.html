<H3>EVR - Usage 
<HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="20%"></H3>

<P>The package is driven by a parameter table, <B>evr_evrpar</B>. Here
is the meaning of those variables. One new feature is that EVR now fits
always dst_track (globtrk) tracks. The user should feel free to experiment
with them:</P>

<UL>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">vcut</FONT>: Cut for determining default vertex tracks</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">cutxy</FONT>: First pass cut in x-y plane for
outlier removal. Track should point back to the vertex at most this distance
(in cm).  Now we use the Z-DCA rms or sigma for this but use cutxy
to limit the cut.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">cutz</FONT>: The same as cutxy but for the beam
axis. This is usually more relaxed. No longer used.  The Z-dca sequence
range determines the z-dca acceptance.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">cut2</FONT>: Second pass cut for outlier removal.
Common value for x-y and z.  Now only used to limit the computed cut 
distance based on Z-DCA sequence rms.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">cut3</FONT>: Last pass cut value. This is usually
a fraction of a cm.  Now only used to limit the computed cut 
distance based on Z-DCA sequence rms.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ptmin</FONT>: Minimum pt track need in order
to be used in the fit.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">covariance</FONT>: Equal 1 (0) to include (not
include) track parameter covariance matrix in extrapolated trajectory
position uncertainty.</LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">fitoption</FONT>: Equal 1 (0) to update
(not update) global track straight line approximations near event
vertex after 1st and 2nd iterations.  Now also, if =2, is used to
let the beam line constrain the vertex fit.</LI>
