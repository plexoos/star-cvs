</h3>
CC-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C
C     Input Arguments:
C
C          psi  = azimuthal angle for pt at first point (degrees)
C          tanl = tangent of dip angle at first point
C          x0   = x coordinate of first point (cm)
C          y0   = y coordinate of first point (cm)
C          z0   = z coordinate of first point (cm)
C          xp   = x & y coordinates of line (parallel to z-axis) to be
C                 approached (cm)
C
C     Output Arguments:
C
C          x(1,2,3,4) = x,y,z coordinates of position on (straight) track
C                       corresponding to the distance of closest approach
C                       to the line thru point xp(1),xp(2);
C                       x(4) is the azimuthal angle of pt at this point
C                       which for straight tracks is identical to psi.
C
C     Description:
C
C          This code finds the position along an arbitrary straight line
C          defined by coordinates x0,y0,z0 and direction determined by
C          psi and tanl, which is closest to an arbitrary line parallel to
C          the z-axis going thru a point at x=xp(1), y=xp(2).
