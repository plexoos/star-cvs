<DT>There is only one module in the package for the moment. This module
(evr_am) is optimized for relatively high multiplicity events (&gt;10 useful
tracks per event). To see the basic philosophy of the fit please click

extracted from the main routine's header). There are two subroutines which
are called by the main routine: 1) <A HREF="vertex_fit.html">VERTEX_FIT</A>:
which performs the least square fit to find a common vertex and 2) <A HREF="project_track.html">PROJECT_TRACK</A>:
which extrapolates a helix to a given space point</DT>
