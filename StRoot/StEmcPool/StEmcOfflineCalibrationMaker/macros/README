README for BTOW gain calibration code contained in StRoot/StEmcPool/StEmcOfflineCalibration/
last updated 16 December 2013

You need the following files to perform the gain calibrations (as of the 2009 and 2011 calibrations): 
StEmcOfflineCalibrationEvent.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationEvent.h
StEmcOfflineCalibrationMaker.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationMaker.h
StEmcOfflineCalibrationElectronAnalyzer.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationElectronAnalyzer.h
macros/bemcCalibMacro.C
macros/btow_mapping.20030401.0.txt
macros/CalibrationHelperFunctions.cxx
macros/CalibrationHelperFunctions.h
macros/electron_drawfits.C
macros/electron_histogram_maker.C
macros/electron_master.C
macros/electron_master_temp.C
macros/electron_tree_maker.C
macros/geant_fits.root
macros/mip_histogram_fitter.C
macros/mip_histogram_maker.C
macros/SubmitCalibJobs.pl

The following files are outdated and can be removed from your working directory: 
macros/all2006runs.xml
macros/electron_ntuple_maker.C
macros/geant_func.root
macros/log4j.xml
macros/mip_ring_draw.C
macros/mip_ring_fitter.C
