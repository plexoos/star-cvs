The Pi0 analysis

This pi0 analysis consists of several components, or procedures:

1. Data collection
This pi0 analysis runs through the STAR data and writes the selected 
information into the trees in the new data format, this is the data
collection pass.

2. Analysis
The trees are read later during the analysis pass to collect the essential
histograms and save them into another set of files.

3. Producing results
The collections of histograms are used to produce the final results.

The following software directories belong to this pi0 analysis:
StPi0Common
StPi0DataMaker
StPi0Analysis
StPi0Results
StPi0Simulation

=================================================================
DATA COLLECTION

The following codes are necessary to run through the STAR data:
StPi0Common
StPi0DataMaker

The STAR framework must be set up.

In order to set up in the fresh directory, run:
mkdir pi0_data
cd pi0_data
$STAR/StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/copy data
./StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/configure data
Then use './submit' to submit the jobs.

There are predefined scripts for 2003 d+Au and 2005 p+p datasets.

The following separate trees can be produced:
1. Events
2. BEMC hits
3. BEMC clusters
4. BEMC points
5. Pi0 candidates, same event
6. Pi0 candidates, mixed events
7. Pi0 candidates, mixed sub-events
8. Monte-Carlo photons
9. Monte-Carlo pi0 mesons
10. Monte-Carlo eta mesons
See StPi0Datastructures.h for details.

=================================================================
ANALYSIS

The following codes are necessary to run through the produced trees:
StPi0Common
StPi0Analysis

The STAR framework is not necessary, this can run on any computer with ROOT.

In order to set up in the fresh directory, run:
mkdir pi0_analysis
cd pi0_analysis
$STAR/StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/copy analysis
./StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/configure analysis
Then use './submit' to submit the jobs.

There are predefined scripts for 2003 d+Au and 2005 p+p datasets.

=================================================================
PRODUCING RESULTS

The following codes are necessary to produce results:
StPi0Common
StPi0Analysis
StPi0Results

The STAR framework is not necessary, this can run on any computer with ROOT.

In order to set up in the fresh directory, run:
mkdir pi0_results
cd pi0_results
$STAR/StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/copy results
./StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/configure results
Then run './show_analysis'

=================================================================
MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS

The following codes are necessary to run through the STAR data:
StPi0Common
StPi0Simulation

The STAR framework must be installed.

In order to set up in the fresh directory, run:
mkdir pi0_simulation
cd pi0_simulation
$STAR/StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/copy simulation
./StRoot/StEmcPool/StPi0Common/macros/configure simulation
Then use './submit' to submit the jobs.

There are predefined scripts to simulate pi0, eta and photons in 2003 d+Au,
2005 p+p and 2006 p+p configurations.

TOOLS

StPi0Common/macros/copy <component>
The shell script to copy the code required by the component to the fresh
directory. Alternatively, it can be manually checked out of CVS.

StPi0Common/macros/configure <component>
The shell script to configure the selected component to be used in
the current directory.

StPi0Common/macros/submit <component> <option=value>
The shell script to submit the batch jobs for the component.
Run 'submit' without parameters to get the complete list of options.
