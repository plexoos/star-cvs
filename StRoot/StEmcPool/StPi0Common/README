Data structures used in the pi0 analysis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a part of pi0 analysis code.
See StPi0Common/macros/README for details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

StPi0DataStructures.h
StPi0DataStructures.cxx
The data structures are pretty self-explanatory, see the descriptions of all fields.
The names for the corresponding datasets, trees and branches are also defined here,
they are used in StPi0DataMaker to write and in StPi0Analysis to read the data.

StPi0CommonUtil.h
StPi0CommonUtil.cxx
The structure that describes the data collection details is defined here: TMyDataAnalysisSettings,
as well as several service functions used elsewhere.

Makefile
The code in this directory can be compiled both with and without the STAR framework.
If the STAR framework is installed 'cons' is the preferrable way, otherwise use 'make'.
