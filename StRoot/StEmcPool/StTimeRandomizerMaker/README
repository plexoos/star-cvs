StTimeRandomizerMaker

A maker that randomly changes every event's timestamp to cover the user
supplied time period. Used to process the Monte-Carlo simulated data sampling
the realistic time-dependent detector acceptance as recorded in the database.

It reads the timestamps file during Init() and generates a timestamp for
every event if one of two modes:

A. Generates a random timestamp and run number using event numbers in the
file as weight (if normalizeEventsTotal is zero).
The run number usually changes on event by event basis, this can generate
a huge CPU and DB load if a significant processing is performed in InitRun().

B. Travels the file sequentially (if normalizeEventsTotal is not zero) by
a fixed step in such a way that after normalizeEventsTotal events the whole
file is covered.
The step is sum(Number of events in file)/normalizeEventsTotal and before
beginning the counter in initialized to a random number from 0 to step.
This way after running many jobs of normalizeEventsTotal events each the
whole time period is sampled according to the event numbers specified in
the file, and run number does not change often.

User has to create this maker BEFORE St_db_Maker.

User's macro:
--------------------------------------------
// Load the library
gSystem->Load("StTimeRandomizerMaker");

// Create the time randomizer
StTimeRandomizerMaker *timeRandomizer = new StTimeRandomizerMaker();
// timestamps filename
timeRandomizer->runTimesFilename = "timestamps.txt";
// ~number of events normally processed per job, set to 0 to have
// a random timestamp every event
timeRandomizer->normalizeEventsTotal = 20000;
// StEvent dataset name when running StIOMaker over event.root files
timeRandomizer->datasetNameStEvent = "IO_Root/.data/bfcTree/eventBranch/StEvent";

// here we create St_db_Maker, it will use the generated event timestamps
St_db_Maker *dbMaker = new St_db_Maker("db", "MySQL:StarDb", "$STAR/StarDb");

TRandom3 is used with zero seed in Init() for the Uniform() random numbers.
