This directory is a placeholder for all FilterMakers.
Each FilterMaker must use either default parameters or parameters
from DB. Selection of them is based on DateTime provided by bfc

It is not clear now how to do it in the case of several filters, 
where different times could be needed. 
Also it is not clear yet if filter from the different year is usable.
When it will be needed we will find the way.
