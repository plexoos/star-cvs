StSmdstMaker

This is the STAR Strangeness MicroDST Maker. It reads data
from the dst_v0_vertex and dst_xi_vertex tables on regular
DSTs produced with bfc, fills the smdst_v0 table, and does
some histogramming, if the DoHistograms(n) member function
has been called. The histograms are update every n events,
with n defaulting to 1.

For the histograms, two canvases are made:
1) V0 canvas has three histograms:
	a) Armenteros plot
	b) K0 mass
	c) lamda mass
2) Xi canvas has two histograms:
	a) cascade mass
	b) omega mass

The macro strange.C can be used to run this Maker.
