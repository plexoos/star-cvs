This maker simulates the level 0 trigger response for EMC.
Now it works only for barrel but a general class StEmcTrigger
was designed to use for both barrel and endcap.

The level 0 trigger for Bemc consists of three variables:

1. Et over a patch of 0.2 x 0.2 (4 x 4 modules) (PATCH)
2. Et of the highest tower inside the patch (HIGH TOWER)
3. Et over a patch of 1.0 x 0.8 (8 modules) (JET PATCH)
4. Ratio between HIGH TOWER and PATCH
5. Total Et

The trigger for each variable consists of three bits, 
corresponding to three different thresholds (In the maker
we can set as many thresholds as we want for each variable 
up to 32). These bits are set to 1 when the corresponding 
variable is above the threshold.

The trigger information is stored in three different tables:

1. emcTrigger - final trigger information
   1.1 - Number of thresholds for each variable.
   1.2 - Threshold values for each variable
   1.3 - trigger bits for each variable.
   
2. emcPatchTrigger - patch information (300 rows)
   2.1 - Patch Number
   2.2 - First module of patch (FirstModule <= module <FistModule+2)
   2.3 - First eta of patch (FirstEta <= Eta <FistEta+4)
   2.4 - Patch Et
   2.5 - High Tower Et
   2.6 - High Tower ID
   2.7 - Ratio HT/Patch
   2.8 - Patch bits (for this patch only)
   2.9 - High Tower bits (for this patch only)
   2.10- Ratio bits (for this patch only)
         
3. emcJetTrigger - jet patch information (14 rows)
   3.1 - Jet Patch Number
   3.2 - First module of patch (FirstModule <=module <FirstModule+8)
   3.3 - Jet Patch Et
   3.4 - Jet bits (for this jet patch only)
   
These tables are stored in .data directory to be easier to get
them in another maker. There are also histograms for QA purpose.
