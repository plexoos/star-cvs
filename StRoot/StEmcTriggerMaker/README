This maker simulates the level 0 trigger response for EMC.

The level 0 trigger for Bemc consists of three variables:

1. Et over a patch of 0.2 x 0.2 (4 x 4 towers) (PATCH)
2. Et of the highest tower inside the patch (HIGH TOWER)
3. Et over a patch of 1.0 x 1.0 (3 crates) (JET PATCH)
4. Total Et

This maker fills StEvent with the simulated trigger
response. You can use raw data or simulated data with
this maker. The data should be in StEvent format.
