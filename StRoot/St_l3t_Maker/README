This maker run the l3 tracking. It has two modes
of operation. if m_mode is zero(non zero) the
Online(Offline) mode is used. The default value of
m_mode is zero.

Online Mode (Default)
=====================

   This mocks up the Level 3 tracking running online.

   Firstly the tracker is invoked once per sector.
The input is the L3 cluster data, generated by the L3 cluster 
finder. Online this is performed by the i960s processors. 
Offline the St_l3t_Maker executes this calculation.
The output of the sector tracker is tracks in online format. 

  Secondly the gl3 is invoked. gl3 is the code running
on the Global Level 3 processor(s). It collects all the
tracks from all the sectors. It merges them and runs the
Level 3 algorithms. 

  Finally the maker fills the l3Track (of type tpt_track)
with the tracks generated by gl3.

Offline Mode
=============

   The input is the offline clusters from the tcl_tphit table.
It runs the tracker with all the hits in the TPC. The tracks
found by the tracker are stored in the l3Track.
