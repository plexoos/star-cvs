Package StChallenger provides interface for STAR software to the
Grand Challenge services.

Purpose: To avoid the dependency of the STAR offline software on the 
GCAClient library, which depends on the GCA software package and the 
ORBACUS CORBA package. 

The GCAClient library is a generic non-experiment specific interface to 
the Grand Challenge services designed to coordinate access to the RHIC 
experiment's data stored on the hpss at the rcf. The Adapter pattern 
(from the "Design Patterns" book) is used to eliminate dependencies 
between the StIOMaker and the CGAClient library.

To get access to the services use the static method Challenge().
Challenge() loads the appropriate shared libraries that implement
the StFileI interface used in by the StIOMaker
