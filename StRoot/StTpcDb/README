StTpcDb is an offline interface for TPC database data.  In order to use this
class, you must specify either "tpc" or "tpcDB" as options in BFC.

StTpcDb has member functions that fetch and return database data in the
form of abstract interfaces.  Currently you can get the following data classes:
 
   StTpcPadPlaneI* PadPlaneGeometry();
   StTpcWirePlaneI* WirePlaneGeometry();
   StTpcDimensionsI* Dimensions();
   StTpcSlowControlSimI* SlowControlSim();
   StTpcElectronicsI*    electronics;   
   StTpcGainI*           gain[24];      
   StTpcT0I*             t0[24];        
                                       
These, in turn, allow you to get the relevant data.  The header files
specify which data is available.  

In order to use these classes, all you need is the pointer to the StTpcDb
class created via the BFC.  There are two ways to get this:

1) gStTpcDb is a global pointer that points to the last instance of StTpcDb.
   Hopefully this is the one created by BFC.

2) Get StTpcDbMaker DataSet using normal ROOT methods.  This has a member
   function:

   virtual StTpcDb* tpcDbInterface() const;    //! return m_TpcDb
