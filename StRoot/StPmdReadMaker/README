StPreadMaker
===========

	This Maker works as an interface between StDAQMaker (and StDaqLib) for PMD
   and outside world of PMD reconstruction.

   	It instantiates PMD reader from StDAQmaker and gets PMD data by using method
   from StPmdReader in StDAQmaker.
	The data are obtained in terms of secno,blockno,cram_no and channel no.

      In this routine we apply mapping on those data-coordinates (mapping code exist in 
   StPmdGeom in StPmdUtil) and then apply calibration constants from database to make the 
   data uniform.

   The PMD (and CPV) hits are then stored in StEvent container as StPhmdHit.
