Description
===========

VERSION 2.0
Lots of changes, I'll probably forget to list them all.
Here are some of the more important ones:

Modified structure of hit collections.  These now
reflect the structure of the detectors.
The StMcTpcHit uses the coordinate transforms (which
in turn use the database).
The StMcTrack now has a 4-vector instead of a 3
vector.
McVertex and McHit now inherit from GlobalCoordinate.
Use memory pool.
List all vectors in StMcContainers.
Introduction of Track Topology map.

--------------
Classes to reflect the contents of the g2t tables.
This package keeps the same spirit as StEvent, but
there are some differences.

The structures have to be filled by hand, this is
done in the maker StMcEventMaker.

Memory Management:
------------------
The whole tree gets deleted when invoking the
StMcEvent destructor, incl. all hits, tracks,
and vertices.

Collection classes
------------------
All typedefs to STL containers, including iterators.
Hits are contained by value, tracks and vertices are
stored by pointer, like in StEvent.  They are all
stored in vector<T>'s.

To be done
----------
At the time of writing the code, there was ongoing
discussion about the proper way to define a "primary
vertex".  It is convenient to define it in terms of
the lifetime of the Pi0, but this was not done previously.
Therefore, in order to handle the previous geant data,
(and a bug in the g2t_vertex table) the package presently
assigns the primary vertex using a spatial cut.  This needs
to be changed as soon as the new primary vertex definition
is propagated to g2t tables.

Tests done
----------
Compiles on hp_ux102, sun4x_56 and i386_redhat51.
