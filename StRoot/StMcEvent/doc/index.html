    <p>
      <b>StMcEvent</b> is a package that compliments the use of <b>StEvent</b>, STAR's
      Data Model.
      The aim of this package is for the user to be able
      to access and analyze Monte Carlo with the same object oriented
      approach as <b>StEvent</b> . The top class is an instance of <i>StMcEvent</i>, and a
      pointer to this  class enables access to all the relevant Monte Carlo
      information.  When running through a typical STAR analysis chain, like the one
      in bfcread.C, a Maker does the actual filling of the <b>StMcEvent</b> objects.
      In this
      case, it is <b>StMcEventMaker</b>.  This Maker then has a member function to give
      to the other makers down the chain
      access to the instance of <i>StMcEvent</i>.  Through this pointer, one can then navigate
      through the tracks, vertices and hits in the event.  Refer to the 
      <a href="./ps/StMcEvent.psnup"> User's Guide</a> for all
      the member functions of <i>StMcEvent</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The information contained in <b>StMcEvent</b> is designed to be simply
    a reflection of the information already available in the existing
    g2t tables.  The primary keys and foreign keys are replaced by
    associations between classes through pointers.
    </p>

    <h2> Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, <b>StMcEvent</b> compiles and runs in Linux, Solaris and HP.  To use it,
      there is a macro available under CVS: $STAR/StRoot/macros/examples/<b>StMcEventReadMacro.C</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This macro will read a geant.root
      file (created using the bfc.C macro) and will load the <b>StMcEvent</b> objects from the
      tables found in that file.
      Note that it does not do any analysis or histogramming at all.  This step would be done later
      by the user once <b>StMcEvent</b> is loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a quick check to see if everything is in place can be made simply by running the
      macro on a particular file.  (The current default is
      /disk00000/star/auau200/hijing135/jetq_off/b0_3/year_1b/hadronic_on/tfsr/set0043_04_56evts.geant.root)
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="courier">root4star[0] .x StMcEventReadMacro.C(10,"myfile.geant.root")</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first argument in this invocation is the number of events to process, and the second
      argument is the file name.
      A successful run ensures that a) the file is there, b) it contains the
      GEANT information, and c) you are able to run the packages in your environment.  You can
      then start thinking about what to do with the GEANT information.  
    </p>

    <p>
      However, looking at the Monte Carlo Data by itself doesn't provide the most fruitful possibility
      for analysis.
      That is why the main goal of <b>StMcEvent</b> is to be used in conjunction to <b>StEvent</b> to
      analyze reconstructed and Monte Carlo data together.  This is done using
      <b>StAssociationMaker</b>.  This package has its own
      <a href="../../StAssociationMaker/doc/index.html">documentation</a>.
