    <p>
      StMiniMcMaker is meant to be a package that fills the classes in StMiniMcEvent.  These are classes to store
      basic information about the simulated and reconstructed tracks for both embedding and fully simulated events (e.g.
      Hijing + GEANT + TRS).  The trees in the output file are then used to make the histograms needed for efficiencies.
      There are two main advantages to storing the pairwise information.  First, when revisiting an efficiency calculation
      with various sets of cuts (e.g. fit Points >=10 vs. fit Points >= 25), one does not need to run StMcEvent, StEvent, and
      StAssociationMaker again, but one simply uses the Trees and changes a cut to make a plot.  Second, once the track
      association is done, the geant.root files and the event.root files need not remain on disk.  This is of special importance
      as these files have the TPC hits in them, and take up a lot of disk space.  One can therefore reduce the needed disk space
      for the same amount of statistics using these trees.

    <p>
      Since several people have made the request for having a mini dst for the Embedding and Simulation data, it is hoped that
      this package will be useful to people.  This has already been used for the h- paper and for the high-pt paper.  The
      algorithms to calculate efficiencies, backgrounds, acceptance, etc. have been incorporated from the code that has
      already been used for the pion, kaon and proton analyses.
      
    <p>
      The macros that are used to run StMiniMcMaker are in the StMiniMcMaker directory: StMiniEmbed.C and StMiniHijing.C.  The
      perl script submit.pl, also in the StMiniMcMaker directory is used to submit jobs.  Since most of the embedding data
      can be found in PDSF, this script is designed to work in the PDSF LSF queue, with some options like the data vault
      resource usage specification.  Running the script without any arguments returns with a screen output detailing the
      usage and options.  Please look at the macros for more information, should be straightforward.
