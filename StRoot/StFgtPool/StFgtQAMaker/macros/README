This is FGT offline chain monitor README
(http://www.star.bnl.gov/cgi-bin/protected/cvsweb.cgi/StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker/macros/README)

How to setup:

  ssh -t -A -Y stargw.starp.bnl.gov ssh -A -Y onl01
  klog
  cd <your working dir>
  cvs co StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker
  source StRoot/StFgtPool/StFgtQAMaker/macros/setup
 
  mkdir /onlineweb/www/fgtStatus/<your web dir>
  ln -s /onlineweb/www/fgtStatus/<your web dir> www
  mv links.php www/

  Webpage will be at http://online.star.bnl.gov/fgtStatus/<your web dir>

  You may need to adjust in makepage.pl at near top:
    $year = 14   
    $start = `date -d "Feb 6 00:00:00" +%s`; $start=~s/\n//g;
  for new RHIC run.

How to run : 

  run#s(14046056/110) and year/date(14046) need to be ones available on eventpool (/evp/a).
  First you need a good pedestal run to create ped & status, then analyze physics run.
         
  runs 14046                              make runlist 14046/run.txt and fgtrun.txt from DB

  root4star runqa.C"(14046056,1)"         runqa.C code with run#, pedestal 
  root makepedplot.C"(14046059)"          make plots for pedesral runs from ped/status text file created by runqa.C
   or
  makeplot 14046059 pedestal              run runqa.C and makepedplot.C, link pedestal.txt and status.txt to new one

  root4star runqa.C"(14046110,1,100)"     runqa.C code with run#, as physics run, and limit to  100 events
  root makeqaplot.C"(14046110,0,1)"       make plots for physics runs from .root file created by runqa.C
   or
  makeplot 14046110 physics               run runqa.C and makeqaplot.C, and copy png and pdf file to web area

  makepage                just make web page for today (not running qa nor making plots)
  makepage 0 submit       make web page for today, and submit makeplot job as needed
  makepage 0 run          make web page for today, and run makeplot as needed
  makepage 14046          make web page for day 14046

  cron                    see if crontab is set
  cron set                setup cron job with crontab.txt
  cron remove             remove cron job

Files generated:
   www/index.php              main web page listing days
   www/<yearday>.php          webpage with plots and links for a day
   www/<yearday>/*.png .pdf   QA plots

   crontab.txt                crontab file to be used... edit this to change cronjob setup
   pedestal.txt               pedestal file linked to last one in <yearday>/ped/ped.<run>.txt
   status.txt                 status file linked to last one in <yearday>/statusstatus.<run>.txt
