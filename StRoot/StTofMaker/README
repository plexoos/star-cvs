	StTofMaker is a StMaker which manipulates raw TOF-slat data, generates
      TOF-hit, and stores the raw data and the generated hit information 
      in StEvent. It is designed to be able to handle both MC and DAQ data. 
      The mode variable of BFC m_Mode should be set to 1 and 2 for DAQ and MC, 
      respectively. At this point, the DAQ reader of StTofMaker has not been 
      implemented.  

        In the processing of TOF data, StTofMaker does the following jobs,
        
        1, to setup a geometry database,
        2, to get TOF-slat data from either DAQ, or MC file, or 
           a filled TOF-slat container in StEvent, 
        3, to generate TOF-hit by extrapolating StTracks to slats, 
        4, to fill TOF-hit container with TOF-hit information, 
        5, to fill StEvent with StTofCollection which includes 
           filled TOF-slat and TOF-hit containers,
        6, to fill detectorInfo in StTrack with TOF-hit information. 

        Classes related to StTofMaker are:

        1, StTofDabase: geometry database of TOF,
        2, StTofCross:  class to perform extrapolations of tracks.
        3, StTofMCSlat: MC slat class inherited from StTofSlat,
        4, StTofMCHit:  MC hit class inherited from StTofHit,
        5, StTofSlatCollection: local collection for TOF slats, and
        6, StTofHitCollection:  local collection for TOF hits,

        Currently, only two trays of TOF are installed. StTofMaker only 
      covers the two trays right now. It will be expanded to cover the whole 
      TOF system in the future.
