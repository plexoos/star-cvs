This implementation of StVirtualFilter class is to draw
the hits from the user provided sector / padrow ('s)

In addition the filter can manage the globtrk 
tables to draw the tracks refered by the seclected hits.

If the "primtrk" table present the tracks from this color will
be "blue". The 'regular" tracks from globtrk is drawn in yellow.

  To use this filter:

  1. Copy $STAR/StRoot/macros/graphic/StSectorHitFilter/*
     to your custom StRoot/StSectorHitFilter directory

     For example:

     cp $STAR/StRoot/macros/graphic/StSectorHitFilter/* ~/StRoot/StSectorHitFilter

  2. Create the filer "share library' as follows:
    
     cons +StSectorHitFilter

  3. Launch root4star to run bfc.C as follows:

     root4star
     root4star[0] .x bfc.C(1,"P00h",< put some daq file here>")

for example:

     root4star[0] .x bfc.C(1,"P00h","/star/rcf/daq/2000/st_physics_1176004_raw_0001.daq")

start "Event Display"
     root4star[1] .x StRoot/StSectorHitMaker/TurnDisplay.C

open your favorit text editor to edit StRoot/StSectorHitMaker/SetRows.C
     root4star[2].! xemacs StRoot/StSectorHitMaker/SetRows.C&

enter there the sector numbers and padrow numbers you want to be seen
Save your new list of sectors/padrows
Run that macro
     root4star[3].x StRoot/StSectorHitMaker/SetRows.C

Wonder your picture

Add for fun PadControlPanel as follows:
     root4star[3].x PadControlPanel.C
