Description:

Fills the Flow Tag Database from StFlowEvent. Stores x and y
components of Q vectors of two randomly chosen sub-events. Also stores
the multiplicity and the mean p_t. Does it for two different selections
on y and p_t for each of six harmonics. Does not use particle ID.

Storing the x and y components of the Q vector allows one to later remove
autocorrelations. Storing the Q vectors for the sub-events allows one
to correlate the sub-events to obtain the event plane resolution.
