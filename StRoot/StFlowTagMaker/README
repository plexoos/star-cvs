StFlowTagMaker

Stores x and y components of Q vectors of 2 
	randomly chosen sub-events
Does it for harmonics 1 through 5
Also stores the multiplicity and the sum pt
Does it without cuts and with cuts
Does not need particle ID
Will have provision for making the event 
	plane isotropic in the lab by weighting with 
	the inverse of the particle azimuthal 
	distribution or by recentering in the x,y plane
Stores and retrieves these constants
Also public: Division of an event into equal 
	random sub-events
