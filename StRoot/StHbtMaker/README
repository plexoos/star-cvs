StHbtMaker - STAR HBT analysis framework

O6jul99 - MALisa - StHbtMaker works now in new/ and pro/
  	  on linux and solaris.

IMPT!! - although you should be in "pro" or "new", you MUST
	 use the "dev" version of the makefile, since StHbtMaker
	 has subdirectories.  To do this, type the following:

	setenv MakeDll /afs/rhic/star/packages/dev/mgr/MakeDll.mk
