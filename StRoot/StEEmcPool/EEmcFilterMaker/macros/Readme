This bfc.C was taken from dev in April of 2008,
It has been modified to work with M-C events and
to make use of the EndcapFilterMaker which aborts events if too little energy is seen in the endcap.
Note, this BFC uses also beam line constrain shifted off x=y=0 - a special DB table is used for that.

Search for string 'JAN' to find where bfc.c was changed.

The goal is to reduce the footprint of output files.
For example for QCD events partonic pt 10-30, already filtered on the pythia level by requirement 20 GeV ET we can get another factor of ~50 in the reduction if Endcap response >17 GeV is imposed in BFC.

For QCD events with partonic pt 30-inf generated the same way, we win factor of 18.

For W-event we win factor of 3.

I run the following BFC options:

bsub -q star_cas_big -J Qcd-b3 -o LogBb3 root4star -b -q bfc.C'(1000,"DbV20080310 trs -ssd upgr13  Idst IAna l0 tpcI fcf -ftpc Tree logger ITTF Sti StiRnd  -IstIT -SvtIt -NoSvtIt SvtCL,svtDb -SsdIt MakeEvent McEvent geant evout geantout IdTruth  bbcSim emcY2 EEfs bigbig -dstout fzin -MiniMcMk McEvOut clearmem -ctbMatchVtx VFPPV eemcDb beamLine","/star/institutions/iucf/balewski/2008-FGT-simu/setC5-pilot/mit0018_3_5000evts.fzd")'
