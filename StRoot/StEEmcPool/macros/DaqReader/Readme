The general daq reader for all STAR subsystems can be found in StRoot/RTS/src/RTS_EXAMPLE/rts_example.C, however for EMC purposes not all of the functionality provided there are necessary.  

The macro emchist.C uses the relevant pieces of the general daq reader to retrieve raw ADC information on a crate/channel level from the daq files and store them in ROOT histograms.  These histograms are useful for many QA and other tasks including timing scans, pedstals, status tables, relative gains (from slopes), etc.

The macro is compiled using the compile.sh script by executing

./compile.sh emchist.C

which produces an executable emchist* which reads the daq file by executing

./emchist /star/data03/daq/2012/100/13100049w_js/st_W_13100049_raw_1340001.daq

for the daq file of interest.
