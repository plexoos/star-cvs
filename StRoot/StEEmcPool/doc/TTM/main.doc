\mainpage TTM - an endcap Tower to Track Match maker and Co

\section intro Introduction
    This a set of MuDST based classes to facilitate tower calibration using matching TPC tracks.
The main class is EEmcTTMMaker and there are few additional classes as EEmcTower, EEmcTTMatch and EEmcTTDisplay.
	

\section algorithm Matching algorithm

    1. Events with CTB sum greater than MaxCTBsum (EEmcTTMMaker::SetMaxCTBSum) are rejected.
    
    2. First build a list of good TPC tracks/event (using EEmcTTMMaker::AcceptTrack)
     - tpc tracks only
     - type() == primary (see StEvent manual for information)
     - flag() > 0        (see StEvent manual for information)
     - hits/track      >= MinTrackHits   (changeable via EEmcTTMMaker::SetMinTrackHits)
     - track  length   >= MinTrackLength (changeable via EEmcTTMMaker::SetMinTrackLength)
     - transverse momentum >= MinTrackPt     (changeable via EEmcTTMMaker::SetMinTrackPt)
     - MinTrackEta <= track eta <= MaxTrackEta 
(changeable via EEmcTTMMaker::SetMinTrackEta and EEmcTTMMaker::SetMaxTrackEta)

     3. loop over all EEMC tower hits (with adc>ped)
     for each track check if it matches a tower at a set of preselected positions (z1,z2,..)
         - extrapolate track to a mZ with EEmcTTMatch::ExtrapolateToZ() to get track intersection with a plane z=z1,z2
         - match is established with EEmcTTMMaker::MatchTrack()    	     
	 - if the distance from the intersection to tower center in eta and phi is smaller than predefined fraction (expressed in tower half-widths), cf. EEmcTTMMaker::SetDeltaPhiCut and EEmcTTMMaker::SetDeltaEtaCut)
	 
    4. If a match is established add a tower with a list of matched track to the list of matches.
    The list is accessible with EEmcTTMMaker::GetMatchList.

\section params Parameters
    Here are the defaults. Each parameter is changeable via corresponding Set method.

    \subsection eventparams Event selection parameters
    - CTB sum is no greater than EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMaxCTBsum

    \subsection trackparams Track selection parameters
    - track has at least EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMinTrackHits hist
    - track is at least  EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMinTrackLength cm long
    - track pt is at least EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMinTrackPt GeV
    - track pseudorapidity at the origin is at least EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMinTrackEta
    - track pseudorapidity at the origin is no greater than EEmcTTMMaker::kDefMaxTrackEta

	
    \subsection matchparams Track matching parameters
    - track must be no further than EEmcTTMMaker::kDefDeltaPhiCut x tower phi-half-width 
from the tower center
    - track must be no further than EEmcTTMMaker::kDefDeltaEtaCut x tower eta-half-width 
the tower center
    - tracks are matched at the following depths (cf. StRoot/StEEmcUtil/EEmcGeom/EEmcGeomDefs.h)
      - pres=kEEmcZPRE1+0.1cm
      - post=kEEmcZPOST-0.1cm 
      - smd=kEEmcZSMD
