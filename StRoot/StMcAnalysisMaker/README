Description
===========
Uses StMcEvent and StAssociationMaker and
does some simple analyses.  It has several
examples and its use is meant to be as a "user
guide" to illustrate the functionality of the
packages.

yet.  This package compiles on SUN, but it
cannot be used yet since it relies on
StAssociationMaker.
