                StuCutEvent and StuCutTrack

 Classes for applying StEvent cuts.
 All functions and data members are static.
 Therefore, there is no need to instantiate.
 Just use StuCutEvent::func(); or StuCutTrack::func(); .
 The reason for making them static was to keep counters of the number of 
	events and tracks removed by each cut.
 Call the PrintCutList functions in Finish to print these counters.

 Right now the event cuts are on multiplicity and primary vertex position.
 The track cuts are on fit points and the ratio of fit point to max points.
 It is set up so that other cuts can be easily added. If lo >= hi on a cut
 the cut is not applied.

 In CheckEvent and CheckTrack the calling argument is a pointer to the event
	or track.

 CutTrack also stores the number of tracks with positive and negative
 pseudorapidity. In CheckEvent::CheckEtaSymmetry these counters are used to 
 calculate (Pos - Neg) / (Pos + Neg) and put a cut on this ratio. The purpose
 is to eliminate beam-gas background where most of the particles would go one
 way or the other.
