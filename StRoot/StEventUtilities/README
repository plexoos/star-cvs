* StEventUtitites
  This repository contains small to moderate sized
  analysis utilities and helper functions/classes
  based on StEvent. Other than in StEvent there is
  no restriction on DB access and use of external
  libraries.
  This file is best edited with (x)emacs.

* Conventions
  All Header files should start with "Stu" instead of
  "St" to avoid name conflicts ("u" for utilities).
  Standard STAR coding rules apply.
  The rest is pretty much up to the author. Important
  is that the class/function must be documented
  in the README file (i.e. this file). Please see the
  template at the end of the file.
  Please no 'makers'!
  If you want to modify an existing utility which was
  not entered by yourself please contact the author
  before you submit you changes.

** StuCounter: functions to count selected global/primary tracks
----------------------------------------------------------------
Files:       StuCounter.hh
Author:      Thomas Ullrich
Date:        Nov 15, 1999
Description:
Set of functions which perform simple counting
tasks. All functions are inline function and one
only needs to include the header file to use them.
No need to link with any library.

Syntax:
       unsigned int numberOfTracks(StEvent& evt, StTrackType ttyp,
                                   unsigned int minHits = 0);
Returns number of tracks in event 'evt' of type 'ttyp' (global/primary)
with greater or equal 'minHits' hits. 'minHits' default to 0.

There are two related specialised functions for the two track types:
       unsigned int numberOfGlobalTracks(StEvent& evt, unsigned int minHits = 0);
       unsigned int numberOfTracks(StEvent& evt, unsigned int minHits = 0);
Examples:
       int n = numberOfTracks(evt, global);
       int m = numberOfGlobalTracks(evt);       // same as above
       int k = numberOfPrimaryTracks(evt, 10);  // all primary tracks with >= 10 hits
       int j = numberOfTracks(evt,primary, 10); // same as above
