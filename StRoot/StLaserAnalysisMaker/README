Time-stamp: <01/28/00 14:02:55 fisyak>  Introduce the package
Time-stamp: <01/05/07 14:02:55 fisyak>  Rework the package to improve laser drift velocity calculations 

* Package: StLaserAnalysisMaker

* Purpose:
Create TTree with predictions from reconstructed laser tracks at the mirrors, drift velocity calculation for each raft 

* History:
The first release is for Run V, used in P07ib and P07ic production
The relase for Run VII
==========================
StLaserAnalysisMaker is maker to produce the TTree
macros:
LoopOverLaserTrees.C("./st_laser_*.tags.root") -- analysis of TTree files (*tags.root) and produce tpcDriftVelocity.*.C
CheckLasers.C                                  -- compare Alexei table for mirror position and 
                                                  one obtained from a bunch of local to master transformations
CheckMirrors.C                                 -- calculate difference between laser track prediction and mirror position
ConverL.C                                      -- recalculate Alexei table into bunch of transformation
Db2NtDv.C                                      -- look for correlation between TPC gas parameters in DB and drift velocities 
Laser.C                                        -- production of  tpcDriftVelocity.*.C for Run V
RaftMirror.C                                   -- adjustment ranf, bundle, mirror positions
