StPeCMaker

Description:
Example Maker for reading DSTs for peripheral collisions. It is
to be called from script doEvents.C (add one line to doEvents.C 
to call StPeCMaker). It takes information from the DST and fills 
a set of histograms. Since the current vertex finder doesn't work
for low multiplicity events, a simplified vertex fit is done. 
Only information from the TPC is used at this time. 

In the future, the vertex fit should be done in the bfc also for
peripheral collisions, eliminating the need for a separate vertex
search in StPeCMaker. The plan is to update StPeCMaker to make a 
more refined event selection and to produce mini-DSTs from this
selection.
