/*! \class StiEvaluableTrack
  StiEvaluableTrack is a class that is used to evaluate the tracker when run on simulated
  data.  StiEvaluableTrack is a StiKalmanTrack.  Additionally it encapsulates the relationship
  between the found StiKalmanTrack, the StMcTrack (monte-carlo) from which it came, and the
  StGlobalTrack (found by existing STAR tracking) that was deembed to the best match to the
  monte-carlo track.  The best match is decided using the existing STAR package
  StAssociationMaker, and the lower bound requirement for the match to be deemed successful
  are determined by StiEvaluableTrackSeedFinder.
