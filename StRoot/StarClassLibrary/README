* README File for StarClassLibrary
==================================

** Introduction
---------------
The StarClassLibrary (or SCL) is a C++ class library which
contains general purpose classes such as:
   3- and 4-vectors
   matrices
   helices
   particle definitions
   ascii file parser
   command line prompt routines
   random generators

The classes are written in vanilla C++ and do not depend
on other packages. This allows their usage also in small
stand-alone applications. StEvent and StMcEvent make
heavy use of them.
Many classes are based on similar classes from:
CLHEP, NA45, Geant4 and RogueWave but without their
inherent dependencies.

The SCL contains a lot of templates which causes trouble
when using these classes in ROOT, or better in CINT.
Most of the affected classes therefore have an equivalent
non-templated version. All this is explained in detail
in the documentation.

** Documentation
----------------
*** On paper
There is only ONE source of documentation and that
is the "StarClassLibrary User Guide and Reference Manual".
This README file is only to tell you how to get it:

	cvs checkout StRoot/StarClassLibrary
        cd StRoot/StarClassLibrary/doc/tex
        make

'make' will make StarClassLibrary.ps. Since the document
is rather large (> 100 pages) it's best to print it on
a duplex printer.
'make' assumes that LaTeX is installed on your machine.

*** WWW
There is also a web page with the latest news
and the ps (& pdf) documentation ready for pickup.
There's also a ps/pdf version with 2 pages/sheet.
Please note, that this page is not updated automatically
and hence might not always be up to date. Check the date
of the last update.
The index.html file in StarClassLibrary/doc will redirect
you automatically to the right URL.

** Outline of the directory structure
-------------------------------------
*** StarClassLibrary:
Contains all header and source files
and the README file you are browsing.

*** StarClassLibrary/doc:
Contains the documentation and an
index.html file which redirects to the
SCL Home Page.

**** StarClassLibrary/doc/tex:
LaTeX documentation. This is the only real source of
documentation there is. This is the one you need!

**** StarClassLibrary/doc/html:
Contains some stuff to create a simple class browser.
Not a big thing. It is only useful for developers, so
please ignore it - unless you want to see the most
excessive use of the <string> class ever written.

*** StarClassLibrary/examples:
Small, stand-alone example programs and a GNUmakefile.
These programs are used to test almost all methods of
the referring classes. They are especially useful when
developing or debugging code or porting to new platforms. 

** Authors
----------
The SCL was written by Brian Lasiuk and Thomas Ullrich.
