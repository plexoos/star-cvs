Description:

StFlowMaker creates StFlowEvent from StEvent after event and track
cuts. StFlowEvent contains a vector track collection which contains
tracks.

In Init StFlowMaker reads the PhiWgt values for making the event plane
isotropic in the lab from flowPhiWgt.hist.root .

In Make it stores in StFlowEvent the PhiWgt values, the original
track multiplicity, and the primary vertex position. In each
StFlowTrack it stores phi, eta, p_t, charge, impact parameter, chi2,
fit points, and max points.

In Finish it prints the lists of cuts and selections.

StFlowEvent contains member functions which return PhiWeight, Mult,
MeanPt, Q, Psi (the event plane angle), and q (=Q/sqrt(Mult)). It
contains the function which sets the flags for each track saying
weather it is used in the event plane of each harmonic and each
selection. It contains the function which makes the random sub-events.

StFlowEvent is used in the flow analysis by StFlowTagMaker and
StFlowAnalysisMaker.

The StFlowCutEvent and StFlowCutTrack classes have all functions and
data members static. Therefore, there is no need to instantiate. Just
use StuCutEvent::func(); or StuCutTrack::func(); . The reason for
making them static was to keep count of the number of events and
tracks removed by each cut. Call the PrintCutList functions in Finish
to print these counters.

Right now the event cuts are on multiplicity and primary vertex position.
The track cuts are on fit points and the ratio of fit point to max points.
It is set up so that other cuts can be easily added. If lo >= hi on a cut
the cut is not applied.

In CheckEvent and CheckTrack the calling argument is a pointer to the event
or track.

CutTrack also stores the number of tracks with positive and negative
pseudorapidity. In CheckEvent::CheckEtaSymmetry these counters are used to 
calculate (Pos - Neg) / (Pos + Neg) and put a cut on this ratio. The purpose
is to eliminate beam-gas background where most of the particles would go one
way or the other.

StFlowConstants contains constants which are used in more than one file.
