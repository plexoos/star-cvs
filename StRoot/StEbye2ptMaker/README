StEbye2ptMaker is a package which makes some quality cuts on p_t and
generates event-by-event p_t and eta spectra which are then used to create a
2-point correlation space.  By taking the ratio of sibling/mixed pair
histograms we are left with the correlations beyond counting statistics and
systematic effects.  By fitting these correlations with known functions
physics parameters can be extracted.  It is important to look at the full
space of two particle correlations instead of an integrated measure such as
phi_pt since the correlations are bipolar and so correlations and
anti-correlations can cancel each other out in the integral.  This analysis
was developed in NA49 and direct comparisons can be made between the results
from NA49 data and results found here. 

The macro Ebye2pt.C can be used to run the code.  The code currently reads
data from an Ebye DST, and writes the relevant histograms to a
user-specified file, which can then be read and plotted in ratio form using
the read2pt.C script.  In the near future a sample fitting script will be
provided as well which can be used to extract relevant parameters and
associate them with physics results.
