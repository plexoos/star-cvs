StEbye2ptMaker is a package which makes some quality cuts on p_t and
generates event-by-event p_t spectra which are then used to create a
2-point correlation space.  By taking the ratio of siblling/mixed pair
histograms we are left with the correlations beyond counting statistics
and systematic effects.  By fitting these correlations with known
functions physics parameters can be extracted.  It is important to look
at the full space of two particle correlations instead of an integrated
measure such as phi_pt since the correlations are bipolar and so 
correlations and anti-correlations can cancel wach other out in the 
integral.  This analysis was developed in NA49 and direct comparisons 
can be made between the results from NA49 data and results found here.

The code currently writes the relevant histograms to a file (currently 
hardwired to be ebye2pt.root) which can be read and plotted in ratio
form using the read2pt.C script.  In the near future a sample fitting 
script will be provided as well which can be used to extract relevant
parameters and associate them with physics results.
