General setup of L0 trigger simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every trigger detector is  represented by a different class, all inherit from the StTriggerSimu.

In the main macro one can disable individually every detector.
Action of one detector does not depend on the others
The isTrigger() result for not existing/disabled  detectors is 'true' by default

L2-algos are implemented in independent maker and in principle do not care about L0 simulator. But user may encode soe event filtering in L2:make() based on L0 decision of any detectors.

Setups for detectors are described in respective Readme files.

For M-C events use switch  
int flagMC=1, // 0== off
if you run on M-C data, make sure you set DB-time stamp for such case:
 dbMk->SetDateTime(20070101,1 );
Only some time stamps work.
