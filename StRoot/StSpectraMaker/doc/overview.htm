<p>StSpectraMaker Package is a framework for calculating spectra for STAR. The 
  framework allows a user to develop and perform various types of analyses, differing 
  by event selection (not yet implemented), particle type and PID method. The 
  framework is designed to be used in two ways.</p>
<p>In the early stages of STAR, multiple spectra projects will be deveoped by 
  a wide range of people, with different needs, requirements on how to cleanly 
  identify particles etc.. Developing these projects within the StSpectra framework 
  has two advantages. First the framweork provides the physicist with common access 
  to efficiencies, centrality cuts etc.. Secondly, when ready, the physicist can 
  easily compare the results of their analysis to other people's work that also 
  have been developed in the framweork. The two analyses can be run side-by-side 
  with exactly the same events, centrality selection, track-cuts etc...</p>
