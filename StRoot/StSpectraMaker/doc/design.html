<P>First some definitions</P>

<P>StSpectraAnalysis : base class that defines an analysis. Contains key information 
  that is used to make spectra; an StEfficiency object, the particle type via 
  StParticleDefintion, and the centrality definition (not yet implemented). This 
  is a virtual class.</P>
<p>An &quot;analyisis&quot; is an instantiation of a class that inherits from 
  StSpectraAnalysis. The idea is there is one derived class for each PID method, 
  e.g. for direct dE/dx PID there will be a class called StTpcDedxSpectraAnalysis, 
  for the number of sigma away from a dE/dx band there is StTpcDeviant SpectraAnalysis. 
  Individual physicists can develop their own derived classes for their physics 
  project.</p>
<p>The framework allows uses to set-up multiple analyses, control the event selection 
  (not implented yet), the efficiency and track cuts, the PID algorithm used etc. 
  Currently the output of each analysis is a 3-D histogram in (y,mt,PID_info) 
  which has had all the efficiecncy, decay corrections, normalisations etc.. For 
  the StTpcDeviantSpectraAnalysis the output is a 3-D histogram (y,mt,dedx_deviant). 
</p>
<p>A second stage of interacting processing (cint macro projectSpectra.C) projects 
  out the PID axis for each (y,mt) bin, fits these and fills the invariant spectra 
  as a function of (y,mt). This stage is kept separate as it is likely to be very 
  specific to each projects, different S/B , fitting requirements etc. In the 
  case of dedx_deviant the PID peak is centered at zero and unit width. The peak 
  can be fit and the area above a background extracted to provide the invariant 
  yield in that (y,mt) bin. This fitting is done interactively, providing the 
  user maximal flexibility over background choices, S/B limits, quality criteria 
  on fit success etc. For mature projects, this projection and fitting can be 
  moved from cint to compiled code and be run at the finish of StSpectraMaker.</p>
