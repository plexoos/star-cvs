<P>StSpectraMaker Package is a framework for calculating spectra
for STAR. The framework allows a user to develop and perform various
types of analyses, differing by event selection (not yet implemented),
particle type and PID method. The framework is designed to be
used in two ways.</P>

<P>In the early stages of STAR, multiple spectra projects will
be deveoped by a wide range of people, with different needs, requirements
on how to cleanly identify particles etc.. Developing these projects
within the StSpectra framework has two advantages. First the framweork
provides the physicist with common access to efficiencies, centrality
cuts etc.. Secondly, when ready, the physicist can easily compare
the results of their analysis to other people's work that also
have been developed in the framweork. The two analyses can be
run side-by-side with exactly the same events, centrality selection,
track-cuts etc.. </P>

<P>As spectra projects mature, a second use of the framwork emerges.
Code that groups of physicists have developed will be available
for others to calculate their spectra. This code can be further
refined if needed for a specific project, or run without modification.</P>
