Description:

Makes histograms for the flow analysis. It removes autocorrelations of 
each particle with respect to the event plane. For each harmonic 
makes a 2D histogram of the number flow, v, vs. y and p_t.

In Finish, it calculates the event plane resolution from the
correlation of sub-event event planes. It then corrects the v
histograms for the event plane resolution. For the doubly-integrated v
values the error on the event plane resolution is folded in to the
error. It calculates the meanSinCos values needed to make the event 
plane isotropic in the lab and outputs them as flowMeanSinCosNew.root . 
To use these values in the next analysis you have to copy this root 
file to flowMeanSinCos.root . If the file flowMeanSinCos.root is missing
the values are set to 0.0 .
