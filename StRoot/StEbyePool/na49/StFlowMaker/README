Description:

** StFlowMaker: 

StFlowMaker creates StFlowEvent from StEvent after event and track
cuts. StFlowEvent contains a track collection (StFlowTrackCollection)
which contains tracks (StFlowTrack).

In Init, StFlowMaker reads the meanSinCos values from
flowMeanSinCos.root . These are used for making the event plane
isotropic in the lab.

In Make, it stores in StFlowEvent the meanSinCos values, the RunID, the
EventID, the original track multiplicity, the centrality bin, and 
the primary vertex position. In each StFlowTrack it stores phi, eta, 
p_t, charge, dE/dx, pid, dca, chi2, fit points, and max points. StFlowTrack
can also calculate total p and rapidity.

In Finish, it prints the lists of cuts and selections.

** StFlowEvent:

StFlowEvent contains member functions which return meanSinCos, Mult, 
Q (the event plane vector), Psi (the event plane angle). It contains
the functions which make the random sub-events and set the pid values.
It also contains the function which sets the flags for each track 
saying whether it is used in the event plane determined for each 
harmonic, each selection, and each subevent. StFlowEvent is used 
in the flow analysis by StFlowAnalysisMaker.

** Cut Classes:

The StFlowCutEvent and StFlowCutTrack classes have all functions and
data members static. Therefore, there is no need to instantiate. Just
use StuCutEvent::func(); or StuCutTrack::func(); . The reason for
making them static was to keep count of the number of events and
tracks removed by each cut. Call the PrintCutList functions in Finish
to print these counters.

Right now the event cuts are on multiplicity and primary vertex
position. The track cuts are on chi2, dca, pt, eta, fit points, and
the ratio of fit point to max points. It is set up so that other cuts
can be easily added. If lo >= hi on a cut, the cut is not applied.

In CheckEvent and CheckTrack the calling argument is a pointer to the
event or track.

** Selection Class:

The StFlowSelection class is used to select events and tracks from
StFlowEvent which have already passed the above cuts. If one calls the
Select() member function with a pointer to StFlowEvent it selects on
centrality. If one calls it with a pointer to StFlowTrack it selects
tracks for the event plane determination which have the indicated
harmonic, selection, subevent, and PID. The SelectPart() member
function selects tracks for correlating with the event plane which
have the indicated pt, total p, rapidity, eta, fit points, ratio of
fit points to max points, chi2, and dca.

** Constants:

StFlowConstants contains constants which are used in more than one file.
