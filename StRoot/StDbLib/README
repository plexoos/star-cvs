Package: StDbLib
Author: R. Jeff Porter

Purpose: General Database API (Application Programming Interface) 
         To provide access to Database to all STAR codes ( Online, Offline,
         & StandAlone)


The package, StDbLib, is a general interface to the database that provides
data in the form of c-structs to the user code based on a simplified
query. To sum up the functionality of this API with the classes that
perform these functions,

1)  Database API

    Manages Access to Servers & DataBases 
      - class StDbManager
      - class StDbServer

    Decodes "Key" definitions into complex navigations & Queries
      - class StDbConfigNode 
      - class mysqlAccessor 

    Handles low level Query of the Database (e.g. SQL)
      - class mysqlAccessor
      - class MysqlDb

    Extracts & Loads Data from the underlying Database structure (Db Buffer)
      - class StDbBuffer
      - class StDbTable

    Can provide user codes directly with Database data
            (but usually this is done via the framework infrastructure)
      - class StDbConfigNode
      - class StDbTable
      - class TableIter

2) Not Database API

    StDbMaker :: Offline Chain's connection to the Database API

    OnlServer :: Online's connection to the Database API
