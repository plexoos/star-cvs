* StEvent Online Info 

The StEvent documentation is currently revised and changes frequently.
A version of the current documentation in PDF format is under cvs control. Use

     cvs co StRoot/StEvent/doc/tex/StEvent.pdf

to retrieve the file. It should be up to date but you better check.
In order to obtain always the most up-to-date version do the following:

     mkdir wrk
     cd wrk
     cvs co StRoot/StEvent
     cd StRoot/StEvent/doc/tex
     make

This creates a PS file StEvent.ps which you can print easily. This requires that you have a complete version of LaTeX installed on your system.
Optionally you can also create directly a pdf file StEvent.pdf:

make pdf

This requires that you have the dvipdf program installed on you system.

For question please send a mail to: thomas.ullrich@yale.edu.
