Primary vertex finder.

Low-multiplicity vertex finder.

<h2>egr</h2>
Primary track re-fitter (using the primary vertex).

<h2>Fixed Vertices</h2>
<pre>
The StPrimaryMaker now has the ability to use a "fixed"
primary vertex. This is useful if a primary vertex fitter (lmv or evr)
is failing, or if you want to test some other portion of code
without any contributions from primary vertex fitting (for
example, testing secondary vertex codes with Monte Carlo
studies of particles produced at (0,0,0)).

The fixed vertex is (OF COURSE!) by default turned off.
And when it is turned on, an annoying warning message
is produced in StPrimaryMaker at each event.

To use in the BFC, copy bfc.C to your working area and edit.
After the chain has been instantiated (chain->Instantiate();)
and before the event loop, you can use:

  primMk = (StPrimaryMaker*) chain->GetMaker("primary");
  primMk->FixVertex(0.1,-0.3,10.5);

For a "fixed" vertex, that portion of evr which determines
which tracks have a distance-of-closest-approach passing
the cut from the evr parameter table (evrpar.vcut) is still
run to determine which global tracks are primary tracks.

The "fixed" vertex can also be switched off with

  primMk->UnFixVertex();

in case one wants to switch on/off the fixing of the vertex
for different events.
