<h1>StKinkMaker documentation</h1>

<pre>
There are three classes which are relevant to kink finding:
StKinkMaker, StKinkLocalTrack and StKinkTrkIdCheck.

The goal of StKinkMaker is to look for charges kaons' kink decays
within fiducial volume (currently r [133,179]). One of the cuts is 
parent pt>02. Other basic cuts which are used in StkinkMaker are 
dca between parent and daughter tracks, distance between parent 
last point and daughter first point, distance between parent last
point and kink vertex, distance between daughter first point and
kink vertex.

StKinkLocalTrack is a subsidiary class. The object of this class
has a StHelix member variable which describes the geometry of the 
track.

StKinkTrkIdCheck is another subsidiary class. It is used for 
checking if two parent tracks (two daughter tracks) have the same
track id. If this is true, reset the iflag entry of dst_vertex.
