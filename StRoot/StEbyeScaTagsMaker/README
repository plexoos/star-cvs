StEbyeScaTagsMaker

  The purpose of this package is to fill the tag database tags which are 
produced by scaled correlation analysis and global variables event-by-event 
analysis.  It is called by simply adding the maker to the chain in a modified 
doEvents script.

  Since the tag database infrastructure is not available yet the tags are 
simply filled and thrown away, although they can be written to the screen or 
to a file by making a couple of simple modifications to the code (remove the
// from the line which sends the tag data to cout for example).

  Currently the only tags which are filled are the global variable tags (i.e. 
eventwise mean pt, eta, temperature) because the EbyeScaMaker is broken.  Once
it is fixed the scaled correlation tags will also be filled.

  To fill the tags the code simply loops over the tracks in each event it is 
given and filters out tracks which fail the quality cuts (which are set 
loosely right now to facilitate use of the EbyeScaTags for QA) and calculates 
the relevant parameters using the remaining tracks. 

  Users should also note that there is plenty of room for expansion so if you 
see something which you feel is missing, need to use a different set of 
quality cuts, or if there is something that you need which fits under the 
umbrella of global event-by-event or SCA variables don't hesitate to contact 
me.
