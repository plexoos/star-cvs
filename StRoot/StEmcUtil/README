Package: StEmcUtil

Authors:
A. Pavlinov, WSU (pavlinov@physics.wayne.edu).

* Purpose:
StEmcUtil is an area for packages that use the EMC software.
At the moment we have here coordinate routines for BEMC geometry
(class StEmcGeom) and service "math" routines.

* History:

Corrected getBin and getId for Jose's scheme (15-march)

Created "functor" class StEmcMath (march 2001)

Originally Aleksei Pavlinov moved StEmcGeom from St_emc_make
(June 2000).
