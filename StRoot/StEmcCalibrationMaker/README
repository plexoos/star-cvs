*
* This maker does calibration on the EMC detector
* The method it is used now is based on equalize the detector
* for each etabin and, after equalization, a MIP peak fit
* is done over all towers in the same etabin to get the
* final calibration constants. 
*
***********************************************************************
*
* There are five new tables:(see .idl file for definitions)
*
* emcCalSummary
*      This table has the calibration summary 
*
* emcCalSettings
*      This table has the global calibration parameters 
*
* emcMipCalib
*      This table has the MIP information for mip fit for each eta bin
*      If etabin is turned off it has MIP peak information for each tower.
*
* emcEqualization
*      This table has all equalization info for each tower
*
* emcCalibration
*      This table has all final calibration info for each tower
