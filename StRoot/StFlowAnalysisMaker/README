Description:

Makes histograms for the flow analysis. If the FlowTagDB exist, it
reads from it. Otherwise, it reads the event quantities from
StFlowEvent. In either case it reads the particle quantities from
StFlowEvent. It removes autocorrelations of each particle with respect
to the event plane and for each harmonic makes a 2D histogram of v
vs. y and p_t.

In Finish it calculates the event plane resolution from the
correlation of sub-event event planes. It then corrects the v
histograms for the event plane resolution. It fits the q histogram
with the q distribution. It calculates the PhiWgts needed to make the
event plane isotropic in the lab and outputs them as
flowPhiWgtNew.hist.root . To use these PhiWgts in the next analysis
you have to copy them to flowPhiWgt.hist.root .
