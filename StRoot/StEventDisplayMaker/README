---------------------
 A new  version of StEventDisplayMaker with  StEvent visualization is ready.
 
 It can display StEvent (*.event.root) and tables (*.dst.root) data.
 You can select any part (subcollection) of StEvent: TPC hits, RICH hits, Primary tracks,
 Kinks tracks etc...
 
 You can filter objects by Rxy,Z,pt,charge etc using default filter.
 
 You can also add your own filter and additional button will be automatically
 generated for it.
 
 A special "self-described" GUI was developed to control of display.
 It is not extremely beautiful, but working.
 
 Some modification of script doEvents.C was made and :
 
    .x doEvents.C(1,10,"<somefile.>event.root","display")
    
    will run this Event Display.

 the old way  with via bfc.C can be used also:

  .x bfc.C(10,"[ bfc options] display","<some>.dst.root")
  .x bfc.C(10,"[bfc option] drawDst","<some>.dst.root")

    
 Right now it is working only in .DEV, but in a few days on DEV will be also
 available.
 
 Any feedback will be very useful.
