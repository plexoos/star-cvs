 <h2>How it works:</h2>
There are several publications, STAR Web 
pages and PowerPoint presentations. 
<P>Essentially StEventDisplayMaker is a class 
to combine the different "geometry" components. 
In addition the components can be passed through the chain of the data-filters. 
This schema is a rather generic. 
<P>We are distinguishing two kinds of the geometry components: 
<ol>
<li>Detector geometry 
<br>
  Geant3 shapes: (See TVolume and TShape ROOT classes) 
  <li>Event geometry: 
    <ul>
      <li>Line
      <li>Dot - to represent hits 
      <li>Helix - to represent tracks 
    </ul>
 </ol>
 <p> <b> What about data/file format?</b>
 <br>
 It is the STAR "maker". It has no own I/O capability at all. 
 It uses the standard STAR framework data-access generic interface and it works 
 with the memory resident data. 
 <p>
   To make it works we need to create a simple STAR chain that should include 3 components:
   <ol>
   <li> I/O maker (or any other maker producing the data) - for the event data 
   <li>St_geant_Maker - for the geometry data
   <li>StEventDisplayMaker.
   </ol>
   
    If one wants some non-standard file format (i.e it is neither the "table" nor "StEvent")
     one should provide her/his own maker instead of I/O maker or between 
     the I/O maker and StEventDisplayMaker one. 
     There is nothing special to describe here. 
     <p>
     For example to access the non-table (i.e. StEvent) the specific access StEventHelper class was developed by Victor 
Perevoztchikov. 
<p><b>What about GUI?</b>
<p>We use the <a href="http://root.bnl.gov">ROOT</a>version based on very 
sophisticated  and very well documented <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">GUI library</a>. 
That allows us to combine the GUI components from Qt and ROOT packages as needed. 
I see no problem to create very complex GUI rather quickly nowadays.
