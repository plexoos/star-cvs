<p>
 A new  version of StEventDisplayMaker with  StEvent visualization is ready.
<p>
  It can display StEvent (*.event.root) and tables (*.dst.root) data.
 You can select any part (subcollection) of StEvent: TPC hits, RICH hits, Primary tracks,
 Kinks tracks etc...
<p>
You can filter objects by Rxy,Z,pt,charge etc using default filter.
<p>
  You can also add your own filter and additional button will be automatically
 generated for it.
<p>
  A special "self-described" GUI was developed to control of display.
 It is not extremely beautiful, but working.
<p>
 Some modification of script doEvents.C was made and :
<code> 
    .x doEvents.C(1,10,"<somefile.>event.root","display")
</code> 
<p>    
    will run this Event Display.
<p>
 The old way  with via <code>bfc.C</code> can be used also:
<code>
  .x bfc.C(10,"[ bfc options] display","<some>.dst.root")
<p>
  .x bfc.C(10,"[bfc option] drawDst","<some>.dst.root")
</code>
    
 Right now it is working only in .DEV, but in a few days on DEV will be also
 available.
<p> 
 Any feedback will be very useful.
