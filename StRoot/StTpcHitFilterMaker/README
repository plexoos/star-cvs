StTpcHitFilterMaker:  David Hardtke, Mar. 22, 2001

This utilility maker is used to filter the hits used for tracking.  Filtering
can be done in z, around the central membrane, by row, and by sector.  The
function names in StTpcHitFilterMaker.h are hopefully self-explanatory.

To use this, you must modify bfc.C and add this maker between St_tcl_Maker
and St_tpt_Maker.  Here is the code fragment you should add to bfc.C:

  Char_t *myMaker = "StTpcHitFilterMaker";
  if (gClassTable->GetID(myMaker) < 0) gSystem->Load(myMaker);
  StMaker *myMk = chain->GetMaker(myMaker);
  if (myMk) delete myMk;
  // Insert your maker after "tpc_hits"
  myMk = chain->New(myMaker,"tpc_hit_filter");
  if (myMk) {
    Char_t *after = "tpc_hits";
    StMaker *tclmk = chain->GetMaker(after);
    if (tclmk) chain->AddAfter(after,myMk);
  }
  StTpcHitFilterMaker* filter = (StTpcHitFilterMaker*)myMk;
  filter->WestOff();

Here I have called the method WestOff() which deactivates the west end of the TPC.
