     This Maker replaces StEclmaker present now in the repository.

     Some of the main changes made on the existing makers are,


     (a) Because of the conflict in class name with StEmcCluster 
   and StEmcClusterCollection currently used in StEvent, the class names
   (and Maker name) are changed as StEmcPreCluster and StEmcPreClusterCollection   etc.

     (b) After some detailed evaluation, some cleanup and initialization
   bugs are fixed.


Just to remind,
--------------

     This Maker is to take StEmcHitCollection from "emc" and perform clustering
   for each module in each subdetectors in EMC.

     These clusters are then stored as StEmcPreCluster objects in 
   StEmcPreClusterCollection.

     These classes are quite similar to StEmcCluster and StEmcClusterCollection
   being used in StEvent, only part missing is the connection of pointers 
   of Rawhits generating the clusters. As soon as writing in StEvent is made
   for StEmcRawHits and StEmcClusters, we can make those connections. 


New Modifications (08/24/2000) by A. A. P. Suaide
-----------------
     
     This Maker is now modificated to take the emc hits from StEvent object
   and should run after St_emc_Maker and StEventMaker. If there is no emc
   hits in StEvent this maker creates a new StEmcCollection and fill it with
   emc hits taken from St_emc_Maker. The clusters are stored in the StEvent
   object but the old storage format (StEmcPreCluster) is kept for background
   compatibility.
