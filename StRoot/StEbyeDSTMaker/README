README

This is a package designed to read a STAR dst and summarize it into an
EbyeDST which contains only the information necessary for EbyE
analysis.  The EbyEDST elements are intentionally independent of any STAR
infrastructure so that data from other experiments (i.e. NA49) can be
written in the same format and accessed and analyzed outside of RCF/BNL.

StEbyeTrack:

  This defines the track type for the DST, which contains all of the
track information that we are interested in for doing EbyE analysis.

StEbyeEvent:

  This defines the event type for the DST, which of course, contains an
array (a TClonesArray to be precise) of tracks as well as the relevant
event information.

StEbyeDSTMaker:

  This is the class which actually does the work of converting the event
data from StEvent into a *.root file which contains the summarized data
we are interested in (using the StEbyeEvent type).

Makefile:

  This is the makefile which is necessary to build the shared library of
StEbyeTrack and Event information needed by ROOT if one wants to access
the DST independent of the STAR infrastructure

ebyeDST2Ntuple.C:

  A sample ROOT macro that accesses the data in an EbyeDST.root file and
writes out a sample ntuple.

----------------------------------------

EbENtuple.C:

  A macro which extracts ntuples necessary for pt fluctuation analysis
(cuts identical to PRL pt fluctuation analysis)

AsciiOut.C

  A macro which shows how to extract ascii data files from an Ntuple made
from EbENtuple.C; the example code is designed for minbias analysis.

DeltaSigma.C

  A macro which uses an ascii data files generated by AsciiOut.C to calculate
CLT-based pt fluctuation measures [Delta Sigma, Phi pt, s2d].

GammaPlot.C

  A macro which to generate a plot showing the difference between the data
and a gamma distribution reference (relies on Gammas.C)

Gammas.C:

  A macro containing function definitions used in GammaPlot.C
